This Agreement sets forth the foundational terms and conditions governing their respective rights, obligations, and relationship concerning the establishment, operation, and governance of [Startup Name], effective as of the Effective Date.</p>\n<h2>3. Purpose and Recitals</h2>\n<p>\nThis Founders' Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into by and among the undersigned individuals (collectively, the \"Founders\" or \"Parties\") to formally establish the foundational terms and conditions governing their collaborative efforts in the formation, operation, and development of a new startup venture (the \"Company\") provisionally named [Company Name]. The primary purpose of this Agreement is to clearly delineate the respective equity interests, define individual roles and responsibilities, establish robust decision-making processes, and secure the ownership of intellectual property developed in connection with the Company's business, thereby fostering a clear, equitable, and stable working relationship among the Founders.\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEREAS, the Founders are [number] individuals who possess a shared vision and have collaboratively conceived the idea for a startup in the [industry] sector, aiming to develop and commercialize [brief description of product/service];\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEREAS, the Founders acknowledge that they have each contributed, or will contribute, significant time, effort, intellectual capital, and potentially financial resources to the initial conceptualization, development, and establishment of the Company;\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEREAS, the Parties desire to memorialize their mutual understanding and agreement regarding the foundational aspects of their partnership, including but not limited to the allocation of equity, the assignment of specific duties, the mechanisms for collective governance, and the protection of proprietary information and intellectual property;\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEREAS, the Parties intend for this Agreement to serve as a binding contract that governs their relationship as co-founders, ensuring clarity, preventing future disputes, and providing a framework for the successful growth and operation of the Company;\n</p>\n<p>\nWHEREAS, the Parties have had the opportunity to consult with independent legal counsel regarding the terms and implications of this Agreement and enter into it freely and voluntarily, recognizing its importance for the long-term success and stability of their venture.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Equity Ownership and Vesting</h2>\n<p>\n    4.1. The Founders hereby agree to the initial allocation of equity in [Company Name] (the \"Company\") as follows: [Party A] shall receive [X]% of the total issued and outstanding equity, [Party B] shall receive [Y]% of the total issued and outstanding equity, and [Party C] shall receive [Z]% of the total issued and outstanding equity. All equity granted hereunder shall be in the form of common shares or equivalent ownership units, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Company's governing documents.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.2. All equity granted to the Founders pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be subject to a vesting schedule over a period of [Vesting Period, e.g., four (4) years] from the [Effective Date] (the \"Vesting Commencement Date\"). Vesting shall occur in equal monthly installments following an initial \"cliff\" period of [Cliff Period, e.g., one (1) year]. No equity shall vest during the cliff period; however, upon completion of the cliff period, [Number]% of the total granted equity shall vest, and the remaining unvested equity shall continue to vest monthly thereafter over the remainder of the Vesting Period.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.3. In the event of a Change of Control (as defined below) of the Company, a single-trigger acceleration shall apply, causing [Percentage]% of any unvested equity held by each Founder to immediately vest upon the closing of such Change of Control. A \"Change of Control\" shall mean (i) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any merger, consolidation, or other reorganization) in which the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to such transaction own less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities of the surviving entity immediately after such transaction; or (ii) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.4. Upon a Founder's termination of continuous service to the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Company shall have the right to repurchase any unvested equity held by such Founder at a price equal to the lower of the original purchase price or the then-current fair market value per share, as determined by the Board of Directors or an independent appraiser.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.5. If a Founder's service is terminated for \"Cause\" (as defined in Section [Reference Section for Cause Definition]) or if a Founder resigns without \"Good Reason\" (as defined in Section [Reference Section for Good Reason Definition]), such Founder shall be deemed a \"Bad Leaver.\" In such case, all unvested equity shall immediately be forfeited, and the Company shall have the right to repurchase any vested equity at a price equal to the lower of the original purchase price or [Percentage]% of the then-current fair market value. If a Founder's service is terminated by the Company without Cause or if a Founder resigns for Good Reason, such Founder shall be deemed a \"Good Leaver,\" and the Company shall have the right to repurchase unvested equity as per Section 4.4, but vested equity shall not be subject to repurchase, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\n</p>\n<h2>5. Roles, Responsibilities, and Commitments</h2>\n<p>Each Founder hereby commits to dedicate their full-time, best efforts, and undivided attention to the development, operation, and growth of [Startup Name], unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon in writing by all Founders.

Founders acknowledge that their roles and responsibilities may evolve as [Startup Name] grows and develops, and they commit to adapting their contributions accordingly through mutual agreement.</p>\n<h2>6. Decision-Making Processes</h2>\n<p>All decisions pertaining to the operation, management, and strategic direction of the Company shall be made by the Co-Founders in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.

Should mediation fail to resolve the deadlock within an additional [Number] days, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions outlined in Section [Arbitration Clause Reference] of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>All decisions, whether Ordinary Business Decisions or Major Decisions, shall be accurately documented in meeting minutes or written resolutions, signed by the requisite number of Co-Founders, and maintained as part of the Company's official records.</p>\n<h2>7.

The obligations regarding confidentiality, non-disparagement, and intellectual property assignment as set forth in this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement indefinitely.\n</p>\n<h2>13. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Founders' Agreement and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of [Governing Jurisdiction], United States of America, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing Jurisdiction] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [Governing Jurisdiction]. The Parties irrevocably agree that the federal and state courts located within [Governing Jurisdiction] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding in such court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between the Parties. The Parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve any such dispute amicably within thirty (30) days of one Party providing written notice of the dispute to the other. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within the stipulated period, they agree to endeavor to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its then-current Mediation Procedures, with the mediation to be held in [City, State].</p>\n<p>Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of the initial request for mediation, or if one Party refuses to participate in mediation, the dispute shall be finally and exclusively settled by binding arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator, mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or failing such agreement within fifteen (15) days, appointed by the AAA. The arbitration shall take place in [City, State], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, and an equal share of the arbitrator's fees and administrative costs of arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise. This arbitration clause does not preclude any Party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction for the protection of its intellectual property rights or to prevent irreparable harm.</p>\n<h2>15.

No waiver shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Party making the waiver. The failure of any Party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy shall not constitute a waiver of that provision, right, or remedy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>15.6 Counterparts.</strong> This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

The Founders acknowledge that the Company will be formally incorporated under the laws of the State of [State of Incorporation] at a later date, and this Agreement sets forth the foundational terms governing their relationship and the Company's initial development prior to such formal incorporation.</p>\n        <p>WHEREAS, the Founders intend for this Agreement to govern their respective rights, obligations, and responsibilities concerning the Company, including but not limited to equity ownership, roles, decision-making, and intellectual property. This Agreement is designed to ensure a clear understanding and commitment among all Founders, providing a framework for collaboration, dispute resolution, and the long-term success of the Company, thereby minimizing potential future conflicts and establishing a stable foundation for growth.</p>\n\n        <h2>1.0 DEFINITIONS</h2>\n        <p><strong>1.1 \"Company\"</strong> refers to the startup entity provisionally named [Startup Name], intended to be incorporated under the laws of the State of [State of Incorporation], and includes all its present and future business operations, assets, and intellectual property. This definition encompasses the collective efforts and ventures undertaken by the Founders in pursuit of the stated business objectives within the [Industry] sector, whether or not formally incorporated at the time of any specific action or discussion.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This also includes any subsidiaries, affiliates, or successor entities that may be established or acquired by the Founders or the Company for the purpose of carrying out the business activities contemplated herein. The scope of \"Company\" is broad and intended to cover all aspects of the Founders' collaborative enterprise from its inception through its formalization and ongoing operations, ensuring that all contributions and obligations relate to this singular defined entity.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>1.2 \"Equity\"</strong> means the ownership interest in the Company, whether in the form of shares, membership units, partnership interests, or other forms of ownership, as determined upon the Company's formal incorporation. This includes both common and preferred stock, or equivalent interests, that may be issued to the Founders or other parties, subject to any vesting schedules, repurchase options, or other restrictions as detailed in this Agreement or subsequent corporate documents.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The allocation of Equity will reflect each Founder's initial contribution, ongoing commitment, and strategic value to the Company, and will be subject to adjustments as mutually agreed upon in writing. Any future dilution of Equity due to fundraising or employee option pools will be addressed in accordance with standard corporate governance practices and will apply proportionally to all Founders unless otherwise expressly agreed.</p>\n\n        <h2>2.0 TERM</h2>\n        <p>This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in full force and effect until the earliest of: (a) the formal incorporation of the Company and the execution of a comprehensive Shareholders' Agreement or Operating Agreement superseding this Agreement; (b) the mutual written agreement of all Founders to terminate this Agreement; or (c) the dissolution of the Company without formal incorporation. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to govern the relationship of the Founders during the critical pre-incorporation and early-stage development phases.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to those relating to Confidentiality, Intellectual Property, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law, and Dispute Resolution, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect indefinitely or for the period specified within such clauses. This ensures that the protection of sensitive information, ownership of created assets, and mechanisms for resolving disputes persist beyond the formal existence of this initial agreement, safeguarding the interests of all parties.</p>\n\n        <h2>3.0 EQUITY SPLIT</h2>\n        <p>The initial Equity ownership in the Company shall be allocated among the Founders as follows, subject to the vesting schedule outlined below: Founder 1 shall receive [X]% of the Equity, Founder 2 shall receive [Y]% of the Equity, and Founder 3 shall receive [Z]% of the Equity. This allocation reflects each Founder's initial capital contributions, anticipated time commitment, specific expertise, and strategic value to the Company's early development and long-term success. All Equity granted under this Agreement shall be subject to a standard four (4) year vesting schedule, with a one (1) year cliff, meaning no Equity vests until the first anniversary of the Effective Date, after which vesting shall occur monthly in equal installments over the remaining three (3) years.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In the event a Founder's relationship with the Company terminates for any reason prior to full vesting, any unvested Equity shall be subject to repurchase by the Company or the remaining Founders at the lower of the original issuance price or fair market value, as determined by an independent appraisal. The specific terms of such repurchase, including notice periods and payment terms, shall be detailed in the Company's formal corporate documents. Any adjustments to this initial equity split, including the issuance of additional equity to new team members or investors, must be unanimously approved by all Founders in writing, ensuring transparency and fairness in all future equity-related decisions.</p>\n\n        <h2>4.0 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>\n        <p>Each Founder shall assume specific roles and responsibilities essential to the Company's operations and strategic development. Founder 1 shall serve as [e.g., Chief Executive Officer], responsible for overall strategic direction, fundraising, and external relations. Founder 2 shall serve as [e.g., Chief Technology Officer], responsible for product development, technical architecture, and engineering team management. Founder 3 shall serve as [e.g., Chief Marketing Officer], responsible for market strategy, brand development, and customer acquisition. These roles are assigned based on each Founder's unique skill set, experience, and commitment to the Company's success, and are critical for achieving the Company's initial milestones and long-term objectives.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Founders shall dedicate substantially all of their professional time and efforts to the Company's business, unless otherwise agreed in writing by all Founders. Any significant deviation from these assigned roles or a Founder's inability to fulfill their responsibilities due to external commitments must be disclosed and mutually agreed upon. Performance will be reviewed regularly, and adjustments to roles or responsibilities may be made by unanimous consent of all Founders to adapt to the Company's evolving needs. Failure to consistently perform assigned duties or meet agreed-upon objectives without reasonable cause may lead to a review of the Founder's status and potential implications for their Equity, as outlined in the termination provisions.</p>\n\n        <h2>5.0 DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES</h2>\n        <p>All major decisions concerning the Company, including but not limited to changes in the business model, significant capital expenditures exceeding [e.g., $10,000], hiring or termination of key personnel, entry into material contracts, or any amendment to this Agreement, shall require the unanimous written consent of all Founders. This ensures that all Founders have an equal voice in critical strategic directions and that no single Founder can unilaterally steer the Company away from its agreed-upon course. For day-to-day operational decisions, a simple majority vote of the Founders shall suffice, provided such decisions do not fall under the category of major decisions requiring unanimity.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Regular Founders' meetings shall be held at least [e.g., weekly] to discuss progress, address challenges, and make necessary decisions. Minutes of all meetings, especially those involving major decisions, shall be recorded and circulated to all Founders for review and approval to maintain a clear record of agreements and commitments. In the event of a deadlock on a major decision that cannot be resolved through good faith discussions within [e.g., 15] business days, the Founders shall refer the matter to the dispute resolution process outlined in Section 12.0 of this Agreement, ensuring a clear path for resolving disagreements without paralyzing the Company's operations.</p>\n\n        <h2>6.0 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP</h2>\n        <p>All intellectual property, including but not limited to inventions, discoveries, designs, software code, algorithms, business plans, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by any Founder, either individually or jointly with other Founders, during the term of this Agreement and in connection with the Company's business, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Each Founder hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to such intellectual property. This assignment includes all moral rights to the fullest extent permitted by law, and each Founder agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to perfect the Company's ownership of such intellectual property.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Founders represent and warrant that any intellectual property contributed by them to the Company is original to them or that they have all necessary rights and licenses to contribute such intellectual property without infringing upon the rights of any third party. Founders further agree to notify the Company promptly of any pre-existing intellectual property that they intend to use in connection with the Company's business and to obtain a written waiver from the Company or a license for such use. This clause is intended to ensure that the Company possesses a clear, unencumbered title to all intellectual property critical to its operations and future commercialization, providing a solid foundation for its competitive advantage in the [Industry] market.</p>\n\n        <h2>7.0 CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\n        <p>Each Founder acknowledges that during the course of their involvement with the Company, they will have access to and become familiar with confidential and proprietary information belonging to the Company, including but not limited to business plans, financial data, customer lists, technical data, product designs, marketing strategies, and trade secrets (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). Each Founder agrees to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to disclose, directly or indirectly, any such information to any third party without the prior written consent of all other Founders. This obligation extends to any information that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential or proprietary to the Company, whether or not explicitly marked as such.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The obligation of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Founder's relationship with the Company for an indefinite period. Founders further agree not to use any Confidential Information for their own benefit or for the benefit of any third party, other than for the sole purpose of advancing the Company's business. In the event a Founder is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, they shall provide prompt written notice to the other Founders to allow them to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. This clause is paramount to protecting the Company's competitive edge and ensuring the security of its vital proprietary assets.</p>\n\n        <h2>8.0 WARRANTIES</h2>\n        <p>Each Founder individually represents and warrants to the other Founders that: (a) they have the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform their obligations hereunder; (b) this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation enforceable against them in accordance with its terms; (c) their execution and performance of this Agreement will not violate any agreement, instrument, judgment, order, or decree to which they are a party or by which they are bound; and (d) they have not entered into, and will not enter into, any agreement that would conflict with their obligations under this Agreement or their commitment to the Company. These warranties are fundamental to the establishment of trust and mutual reliance among the Founders.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, each Founder warrants that they will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards in the performance of their duties for the Company. They also warrant that all information provided by them to the other Founders and to the Company regarding their background, qualifications, and experience is true, accurate, and complete. Any breach of these warranties shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement, potentially leading to remedies including but not limited to indemnification obligations or adjustments to equity, as further detailed in other sections of this Agreement or subsequent corporate documents.</p>\n\n        <h2>9.0 INDEMNIFICATION</h2>\n        <p>Each Founder (\"Indemnifying Founder\") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and the other Founders (each, an \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with: (a) any breach of the Indemnifying Founder's representations, warranties, or covenants under this Agreement; (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Founder in connection with their duties or actions related to the Company; or (c) any third-party claim alleging that the Indemnifying Founder's contributions to the Company infringe upon any intellectual property rights of such third party. This indemnification obligation is crucial for protecting the collective interests of the Founders and the Company from individual misconduct or breaches.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Indemnified Party shall provide prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Founder of any claim for which indemnification is sought. The Indemnifying Founder shall have the right to assume the defense of any such claim with counsel of its own choosing, subject to the Indemnified Party's reasonable approval. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Founder in the defense of such claim. This indemnification clause is intended to ensure that any financial burdens or legal liabilities arising from a Founder's specific actions or omissions are borne by that Founder, rather than by the Company or the other innocent Founders, thereby maintaining fairness and accountability within the founding team.</p>\n\n        <h2>10.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>\n        <p>EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS ARISING FROM A FOUNDER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, FRAUD, OR BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NO FOUNDER SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOUNDERS OR THE COMPANY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation is intended to protect Founders from unforeseen or disproportionate liabilities arising from the inherent risks of a startup venture, fostering an environment where Founders can take calculated risks without fear of excessive personal financial exposure for ordinary business failures.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In no event shall any Founder's aggregate liability to the other Founders or the Company for any claims arising out of or related to this Agreement exceed the total value of the Equity held by such Founder at the time the claim arises, excluding the specific carve-outs for gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or breaches of confidentiality and intellectual property. This cap on liability aims to provide a reasonable limit on financial exposure while still ensuring accountability for severe breaches. The parties acknowledge that this limitation of liability is a material term of this Agreement and that the Founders would not have entered into this Agreement without such limitation.</p>\n\n        <h2>11.0 TERMINATION</h2>\n        <p>This Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Founder (\"Terminating Founder\") under the following circumstances: (a) by mutual written agreement of all Founders; (b) by unanimous written decision of the remaining Founders if a Terminating Founder commits a material breach of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, failure to perform assigned duties, breach of confidentiality, or unauthorized disclosure of IP) and fails to cure such breach within [e.g., 30] days after receiving written notice thereof; (c) upon the death or permanent disability of a Founder; or (d) if a Founder engages in any act of fraud, embezzlement, or other criminal activity related to the Company's business. Upon such termination, the Terminating Founder's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except for surviving provisions, shall cease.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Upon termination of a Founder's involvement, the Terminating Founder shall immediately return all Company property, Confidential Information, and intellectual property in their possession or control. The unvested Equity of a Terminating Founder shall be subject to repurchase by the Company or the remaining Founders at a price and on terms to be determined by the circumstances of termination (e.g., \"for cause\" vs. \"without cause\" vs. death/disability), as further detailed in the Company's formal corporate documents. This clause is designed to provide clear mechanisms for addressing situations where a Founder's continued involvement is no longer feasible or desirable, ensuring a smooth transition and protecting the interests of the ongoing Company and remaining Founders.</p>\n\n        <h2>12.0 GOVERNING LAW</h2>\n        <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Jurisdiction for Governing Law], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. This choice of law is intended to provide certainty and predictability in the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, ensuring that all parties understand the legal framework under which their rights and obligations are defined. The parties acknowledge that the Company is intended to be incorporated in this jurisdiction, making its laws the most appropriate for governing this foundational agreement.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The application of [Jurisdiction for Governing Law] law shall extend to all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement. Any legal actions or proceedings related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in [Jurisdiction for Governing Law], and the Founders hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. This ensures that any legal disputes are resolved within a familiar and consistent legal environment, minimizing jurisdictional complexities and potential delays.</p>\n\n        <h2>13.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>\n        <p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subjected to good faith negotiations between the Founders. If the Founders are unable to resolve the dispute through direct negotiations within [e.g., 30] days of one Founder giving written notice of the dispute to the others, the dispute shall then be submitted to non-binding mediation in [City, State] before a mutually agreed-upon mediator. The costs of mediation shall be borne equally by the Founders involved in the dispute. This tiered approach aims to resolve conflicts amicably and efficiently, preserving the Founders' working relationship where possible.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within [e.g., 60] days of the mediator's appointment, or if any Founder fails to participate in mediation, the dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration administered by [e.g., the American Arbitration Association (AAA)] in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall take place in [City, State], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. There shall be [e.g., one (1)] arbitrator, who shall be a retired judge or an attorney with at least [e.g., ten (10)] years of experience in corporate law. This binding arbitration clause is intended to provide a final, efficient, and cost-effective method for resolving disputes, avoiding protracted litigation.</p>\n\n        <h2>14.0 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h2>\n        <p><strong>14.1 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Founders with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, between the Founders relating to such subject matter. No oral representations, inducements, promises, or agreements not embodied herein shall be of any force or effect. The parties acknowledge that they have not relied on any representations or warranties not expressly set forth in this Agreement.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This clause is fundamental to ensuring that the terms outlined herein are the definitive and complete understanding between the Founders, preventing future claims based on prior informal discussions or unwritten agreements. Any future modifications or additions to the terms governing the Founders' relationship or the Company's operations must be formally documented to be legally binding, thereby providing clarity and reducing potential ambiguities.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>14.2 Amendments.</strong> This Agreement may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except by a written instrument executed by all Founders. Any attempted amendment, modification, or supplement not in conformity with this provision shall be null and void. This strict requirement for unanimous written consent ensures that no Founder can unilaterally alter the fundamental terms of their shared venture, protecting the interests of all parties involved.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The requirement for a formal written amendment serves to prevent misunderstandings and disputes that could arise from informal or verbal agreements. It emphasizes the importance of clear, documented consent for any changes to the foundational structure and governance of the Company, reinforcing the collective nature of the Founders' commitment and decision-making process.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>14.3 Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. The remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. This clause ensures the continuity and enforceability of the Agreement even if specific parts are deemed legally problematic.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The intent behind this severability clause is to preserve the overall integrity and purpose of the Agreement, allowing the Founders' core understanding and operational framework to remain intact despite the potential invalidation of a minor or ancillary provision. It reflects a commitment to the spirit of the Agreement and its foundational principles, even in the face of unforeseen legal challenges to specific terms.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>14.4 Notices.</strong> All notices, requests, demands, and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally, sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested, postage prepaid), or sent by email with confirmation of receipt, to the addresses or email addresses provided for each Founder at the beginning of this Agreement. Any Founder may change their address or email address for notice purposes by providing written notice to the other Founders.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">This provision establishes clear and formal channels for communication among the Founders, ensuring that all critical information, requests, or legal notices are properly delivered and acknowledged. Adherence to these notice requirements is essential for maintaining transparency, meeting contractual obligations, and avoiding disputes arising from a lack of proper communication within the founding team.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>14.5 Assignment.</strong> No Founder may assign their rights or delegate their obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of all other Founders. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this provision shall be null and void. This restriction ensures that the personal commitment and specific contributions of each Founder remain central to the Company's success and that the composition of the founding team cannot be unilaterally altered.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The non-assignment clause is critical for a Founders' Agreement, as the success of a startup heavily relies on the specific individuals involved and their unique skills and relationships. It prevents a Founder from transferring their responsibilities or equity interests to an unknown or undesirable third party, thereby protecting the integrity of the founding team and the Company's future trajectory.</p>\n\n        <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Founders have executed this Founders' Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above.</p>\n\n        <table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-bottom: 30pt;\">\n                    <p>___________________________________</p>\n                    <p><strong>[Co-founder 1 Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-bottom: 30pt;\">\n                    <p>___________________________________</p>\n                    <p><strong>[Co-founder 2 Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-bottom: 30pt;\">\n                    <p>___________________________________</p>\n                    <p><strong>[Co-founder 3 Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-bottom: 30pt;\">\n                    <p><em>[Add additional signature blocks as needed]</em></p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Formation and Duration</h2>\n<p>2.1. Formation. The Company, [LLC Name], was duly formed as a limited liability company under the provisions of the [State] Limited Liability Company Act (the “Act”), by the filing of its Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State of [State] on [Formation Date]. This Operating Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into by and among the Members identified herein, effective as of [Effective Date] (the “Effective Date”), and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the Company.</p>\n<p>2.2. Name. The name of the Company is [LLC Name]. The Company may conduct business under other names as permitted by applicable law and approved by the Members in accordance with this Agreement.</p>\n<p>2.3. Principal Office. The principal office of the Company shall be located at [Principal Office Address], or such other location as the Members may determine from time to time.</p>\n<p>2.4. Duration. The Company shall have perpetual existence unless sooner dissolved and terminated in accordance with the provisions of Article [X. Dissolution] of this Agreement or as otherwise provided by the Act. The existence of the Company as a legal entity shall continue until cancellation of its Articles of Organization in accordance with the Act.</p>\n<h2>3. Members and Membership Interests</h2>\n<p>\n    The initial Members of [LLC Name] (the \"Company\") and their respective Membership Interests, expressed as a percentage of the total ownership of the Company, are set forth in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Each Member's Membership Interest represents their undivided share of the capital, profits, losses, and distributions of the Company, as well as their voting rights and other rights and obligations as specified in this Operating Agreement. The aggregate Membership Interests of all Members shall at all times equal one hundred percent (100%).\n</p>\n<p>\n    Membership Interests shall be deemed personal property for all purposes and shall not entitle any Member to any right to partition or severance of any Company property. No Member shall have the right to demand or receive any distribution in kind from the Company. The admission of any new Member or the transfer of any Membership Interest shall be strictly governed by the provisions of Article [Relevant Article Number, e.g., 8] of this Agreement, and any purported admission or transfer not in compliance therewith shall be null and void.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Company shall maintain an accurate record of all Members and their respective Membership Interests, which record shall be updated promptly upon any change in membership or ownership percentages in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. This record, along with <strong>Exhibit A</strong>, shall constitute the definitive statement of the Members' ownership in the Company.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Capital Contributions</h2>\n<p>Each Member shall contribute to the capital of [LLC Name] the amount of cash, property, or services as set forth opposite their name in Exhibit A, \"Schedule of Members and Capital Contributions,\" attached hereto and incorporated by reference. The value assigned to any non-cash contribution shall be the fair market value as agreed upon by all Members at the time of contribution. These initial contributions shall be deemed fully paid and non-assessable as of the [Effective Date].</p>\n<p>Except as expressly provided in this Operating Agreement, no Member shall be required to make any additional capital contributions to [LLC Name] beyond their initial contribution. No Member shall have any personal liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of [LLC Name] solely by reason of being a Member, except to the extent of their capital contributions and any distributions wrongfully received.</p>\n<p>Should the Members unanimously determine that additional capital is required for the operations or expansion of [LLC Name], they may, by a unanimous vote of all Members, call for additional capital contributions. Any such call shall specify the amount required, the purpose, and the terms and conditions for such contributions. Members shall have the right, but not the obligation, to contribute their pro rata share of such additional capital based on their then-current Percentage Interests.</p>\n<p>If any Member fails to contribute their pro rata share of an authorized additional capital contribution, the other Members may elect to contribute the deficit amount. In such an event, the Percentage Interests of the Members shall be recomputed to reflect the new capital contributions, and the Percentage Interest of the non-contributing Member shall be diluted accordingly, in a manner that equitably reflects the new capital structure, or as otherwise agreed upon by the contributing Members.</p>\n<p>No Member shall be entitled to the return of their capital contributions, nor to interest on their capital contributions, except upon the dissolution and winding up of [LLC Name] or as otherwise expressly provided in this Operating Agreement. The capital accounts of the Members shall be maintained in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).</p>\n<h2>5. Allocations and Distributions</h2>\n<p>\n    5.1. **Allocation of Net Profits and Net Losses.** For federal income tax purposes and for purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts of the Members, Net Profits and Net Losses of the Company for each fiscal year shall be allocated among the Members pro rata in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests. All allocations shall be made in accordance with Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, the \"minimum gain chargeback\" and \"qualified income offset\" provisions thereof.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5.2. **Maintenance of Capital Accounts.** A separate Capital Account shall be maintained for each Member in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Each Member's Capital Account shall be increased by (a) the amount of money contributed by such Member to the Company, (b) the fair market value of property contributed by such Member to the Company (net of liabilities assumed or taken subject to by the Company), and (c) allocations of Net Profits and other items of income and gain to such Member. Each Member's Capital Account shall be decreased by (x) the amount of money distributed to such Member by the Company, (y) the fair market value of property distributed to such Member by the Company (net of liabilities assumed or taken subject to by such Member), and (z) allocations of Net Losses and other items of deduction and loss to such Member.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5.3. **Distributions of Distributable Cash.** Subject to the provisions of Section 5.4 and any limitations imposed by applicable law, the Manager shall, from time to time, but not less frequently than quarterly, distribute to the Members all \"Distributable Cash\" (as defined below) in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests. \"Distributable Cash\" shall mean all cash funds of the Company, from whatever source derived, in excess of the amount determined by the Manager to be necessary for the payment of all current and anticipated Company expenses, including, without limitation, operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditures, and reasonable reserves for future operations and contingencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5.4. **Tax Distributions.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent the Company has taxable income, the Company shall make mandatory distributions to each Member sufficient to cover such Member's federal, state, and local income tax liabilities attributable to the Member's share of the Company's taxable income. Such distributions shall be made no later than [Ten (10) Days] prior to the due date for estimated tax payments for individuals and corporations, or such other date as is necessary to ensure Members have funds to pay their tax obligations. The amount of such tax distributions shall be calculated based on the highest combined marginal federal, [State], and local income tax rates applicable to an individual or corporate resident of [State], taking into account the character of the income (e.g., ordinary income, capital gains), and shall be treated as an advance against future distributions of Distributable Cash.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Management Structure and Member Roles</h2>\n<p>The Company shall be a Member-Managed Limited Liability Company. Subject to the specific provisions of this Operating Agreement, all Members shall have the right to participate in the management and control of the Company's business and affairs. Each Member shall have the authority to bind the Company in matters pertaining to the ordinary course of its business, provided such actions are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and any resolutions duly adopted by the Members.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the general Member-management structure, certain Members may be assigned specific functional roles or responsibilities to facilitate the efficient operation of the Company. For instance, [Member A] may be designated as the \"Managing Member,\" primarily responsible for overseeing the Company's financial administration, banking relationships, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Similarly, [Member B] may be designated as the \"Operations Lead,\" responsible for day-to-day operational management, client relations, and project execution. The specific duties and scope of authority for any such designated role shall be defined by a separate written resolution or addendum approved by a [Majority/Unanimous] vote of all Members.</p>\n<p>No single Member, regardless of any designated role, shall have the authority to incur debt exceeding [Amount in USD], sell or encumber substantially all of the Company's assets, or enter into any contract or agreement outside the ordinary course of business without the prior written consent of a [Supermajority/All] of the Members. All Members, in their capacity as managers, shall owe fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the Company and its Members, requiring them to act in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.</p>\n<h2>7. Voting Rights and Member Meetings</h2>\n<p>\n    Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Operating Agreement, each Member shall be entitled to one vote for each one percent (1%) of Percentage Interest held by such Member in the Company. All decisions of the Members regarding the ordinary course of business of the Company shall require the affirmative vote of Members holding a simple majority of the Percentage Interests. However, certain extraordinary actions, including but not limited to, amending this Operating Agreement, dissolving the Company, admitting new Members, or selling all or substantially all of the Company's assets, shall require the affirmative vote of Members holding at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Percentage Interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n    An annual meeting of the Members shall be held on or about [Date of Annual Meeting] of each year, or at such other time as may be agreed upon by the Members, for the purpose of reviewing the Company's performance and addressing any other matters requiring Member approval. Special meetings of the Members may be called by any Member holding at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the Percentage Interests, upon not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days' prior written notice to all other Members, stating the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A quorum for any meeting of the Members shall consist of Members holding at least a majority of the Percentage Interests. If a quorum is not present at any meeting, the meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the Members present, and no further notice of the adjourned meeting need be given other than by announcement at the meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Members may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by all of the Members entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. Such written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Members.\n</p>\n<h2>8. Transfers of Membership Interests</h2>\n<p>8.1. General Restriction. No Member shall sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise dispose of all or any part of their Membership Interest in [LLC Name] (hereinafter, \"Membership Interest\") to any Person (as defined herein) without the express prior written consent of all other Members, or a supermajority of Members holding at least [Percentage]% of the aggregate Membership Interests, as determined by a vote in accordance with Section [Voting Rights Section Number] of this Agreement, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Section 8. Any purported transfer in violation of this Section 8 shall be null and void ab initio and shall not be recognized by [LLC Name] or its Members.</p>\n<p>8.2. Right of First Refusal. Before any Member (the \"Transferring Member\") may sell, assign, or otherwise transfer their Membership Interest to a third party (a \"Proposed Transferee\"), the Transferring Member shall first offer such Membership Interest to [LLC Name] and then, if declined by the LLC, to the remaining Members (the \"Non-Transferring Members\") on the same terms and conditions as offered to the Proposed Transferee. The Transferring Member shall provide written notice (the \"Transfer Notice\") to the LLC and all Non-Transferring Members, specifying in detail the terms, conditions, and identity of the Proposed Transferee. The LLC shall have [Number] days from receipt of the Transfer Notice to elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Membership Interest. If the LLC declines or fails to exercise its option within said period, the Non-Transferring Members shall have an additional [Number] days to collectively or individually elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Membership Interest on the same terms. Any purchase hereunder shall be completed within [Number] days of the exercise of the option, with payment in cash or other mutually agreed-upon consideration.</p>\n<p>8.3. Conditions to Permitted Transfer. Any permitted transfer of a Membership Interest, whether pursuant to Section 8.2 or otherwise, shall be subject to the following conditions precedent: (a) the Proposed Transferee shall execute a joinder agreement, in a form satisfactory to [LLC Name], agreeing to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Operating Agreement, as if an original signatory hereto; (b) the Transferring Member shall provide an opinion of counsel, satisfactory in form and substance to the Non-Transferring Members, confirming that such transfer will not violate any applicable federal or [State] securities laws; and (c) the transfer shall not cause [LLC Name] to be treated as a \"publicly traded partnership\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Transferring Member shall bear all costs and expenses associated with satisfying these conditions.</p>\n<p>8.4. Permitted Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, a Member may transfer all or a portion of their Membership Interest to (a) an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent, sibling), (b) a trust established solely for the benefit of the Member or immediate family members, or (c) an entity wholly owned by the Member or immediate family members, provided that in each such instance, the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by all provisions of this Agreement and the transfer is for bona fide estate planning purposes and not for value. Such transfers shall require prior written notice to the LLC and Non-Transferring Members but shall not be subject to the Right of First Refusal in Section 8.2, though they remain subject to the conditions of Section 8.3(a) and (c).</p>\n<p>8.5. Indemnification. The Transferring Member shall indemnify and hold harmless [LLC Name] and the Non-Transferring Members from and against any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred as a result of any transfer or purported transfer of a Membership Interest not in strict compliance with the terms of this Section 8, or as a result of any breach by the Transferring Member of their obligations hereunder.</p>\n<h2>9. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>Each Member acknowledges that during the course of their involvement with [LLC Name], they may obtain or have access to confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information concerning the business, operations, finances, strategies, customers, and other Members of [LLC Name] (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). Confidential Information shall include, but not be limited to, financial statements, business plans, marketing strategies, customer lists, vendor information, operational procedures, intellectual property, and any other non-public information, whether written, oral, or electronic, that is designated as confidential or would reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Each Member agrees to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, nor use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the benefit of [LLC Name] or as specifically authorized by this Agreement or by the unanimous written consent of the Members. This obligation of confidentiality shall survive the withdrawal or termination of a Member's interest in [LLC Name] and shall remain in full force and effect indefinitely. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving Member, (b) is rightfully received by the receiving Member from a third party without restriction on disclosure, (c) is independently developed by the receiving Member without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided that the disclosing Member provides prompt notice to [LLC Name] to allow for protective measures.</p>\n<h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>The Limited Liability Company (the \"LLC\") shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all intellectual property (IP) developed, conceived, created, or acquired by the LLC, its Members, managers, employees, or agents in the course of the LLC's business or with the use of the LLC's resources, including but not limited to, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, designs, software, business methods, and know-how. Each Member hereby irrevocably assigns, and agrees to assign, to [LLC Name] all right, title, and interest in and to any and all IP created, developed, or conceived by such Member, either individually or jointly with others, within the scope of their duties or engagement with the LLC, or that relates to the business of the LLC, during the term of their membership or engagement with the LLC.</p>\n<p>Members shall promptly disclose to the LLC any such IP and execute all documents and take all actions reasonably requested by the LLC to perfect the LLC's ownership of such IP. Members further agree that any pre-existing IP contributed by a Member to the LLC's operations shall be deemed licensed to the LLC on a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable basis for the purpose of conducting the LLC's business, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing between the contributing Member and the LLC. This provision shall survive the termination of any Member's association with the LLC. Members shall not use the LLC's IP for any purpose other than for the benefit of the LLC, nor shall they disclose any confidential or proprietary information of the LLC to any third party without prior written consent of the Managers or a majority of the Members, as applicable.</p>\n<h2>11. Warranties</h2>\n<p>Each Member hereby represents, warrants, and covenants to the Company and to each other Member, as of the [Effective Date] and continuously thereafter for the duration of their membership, that:</p>\n<p>(a) Such Member has the full power, authority, and legal capacity to execute and deliver this Operating Agreement and to perform all of its obligations hereunder. This Operating Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of such Member, enforceable against such Member in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity.</p>\n<p>(b) The execution, delivery, and performance by such Member of this Operating Agreement do not and will not violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, judgment, order, decree, or other restriction to which such Member is a party or by which such Member is bound, nor will it violate any law, rule, or regulation applicable to such Member.</p>\n<p>(c) All information, including but not limited to financial and personal information, provided by such Member to the Company or other Members in connection with the formation of the Company, the execution of this Operating Agreement, or any subsequent capital contribution or transaction, is true, accurate, and complete in all material respects and does not omit any material fact necessary to make the statements made not misleading.</p>\n<p>(d) Such Member is not insolvent and has not filed, nor is subject to, any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or similar proceeding under any federal or state law, and no such proceeding is pending or, to the best of such Member's knowledge, threatened against such Member.</p>\n<p>(e) If such Member is an entity, it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has all necessary corporate or other organizational power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.</p>\n<h2>12. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>\n    To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of [State], [LLC Name] (the \"Company\") shall indemnify and hold harmless each Member, Manager, Officer, employee, and agent of the Company (each, an \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, arising from any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Party in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Company, and within the scope of the authority conferred by this Operating Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or material breach of any provision of this Operating Agreement or any fiduciary duty owed to the Company or its Members. The Company may, in its sole discretion, advance expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in defending any such action, suit, or proceeding, provided that such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party may be entitled under any statute, agreement, vote of Members, or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a Member, Manager, Officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.\n</p>\n<h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>To the fullest extent permitted by the [State] Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act, as amended from time to time, and any other applicable law, no Member or Manager of [LLC Name] shall be liable to the Company or to any other Member for any loss, damage, or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Member or Manager in good faith on behalf of the Company and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred by this Operating Agreement, except for any such loss, damage, or claim arising out of the Member's or Manager's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of law. This limitation of liability shall not affect the liability of any Member or Manager for their own capital contributions or for the return of distributions made in violation of applicable law. All debts, obligations, and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the Company, and no Member or Manager shall be obligated personally for any such debt, obligation, or liability of the Company solely by reason of being a Member or Manager of the Company.</p>\n<h2>14. Dissolution and Liquidation</h2>\n<p>\nUpon the occurrence of any event causing the dissolution of [LLC Name] as provided by the [State] Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act, as amended (the \"Act\"), or as otherwise expressly agreed upon by the Members in writing, the business of [LLC Name] shall be wound up and liquidated. Such events of dissolution shall include, but not be limited to, the unanimous written consent of all Members, the entry of a judicial decree of dissolution, or the occurrence of any other event specified in the Act as requiring the dissolution of a limited liability company.\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon dissolution, the Members shall immediately proceed to wind up the affairs of [LLC Name]. A liquidating trustee, who may be one or more of the Members or a third party appointed by the affirmative vote of Members holding a majority of the then-current Percentage Interests, shall be appointed to oversee the liquidation process. The liquidating trustee shall be responsible for collecting all assets of [LLC Name], paying or making provision for the payment of all debts and liabilities of [LLC Name], and distributing the remaining assets in the following order of priority:\n</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>First, to creditors of [LLC Name], including Members who are creditors, to the extent permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of [LLC Name], whether by payment or by establishment of reserves, other than liabilities for distributions to Members.</li>\n    <li>Second, to Members for the return of their Capital Contributions, pro rata in accordance with their respective unreturned Capital Contributions.</li>\n    <li>Third, to Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe winding up shall be completed as soon as reasonably practicable. In no event shall any Member be personally liable for the debts or obligations of [LLC Name] during or after the liquidation process, except to the extent of their Capital Contributions and any undistributed profits. The provisions of this Section 14 shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State], specifically the Act.\n</p>\n<h2>15. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Operating Agreement and all rights and obligations of the Members and the Company hereunder shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [State of Formation], without regard to its conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in [County, State of Formation] for any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such action, suit, or proceeding in such courts and irrevocably waives any right to plead or claim that any such action, suit, or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<h2>16. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Operating Agreement, including without limitation the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof, or the relationships established hereunder, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between the Members involved for a period of not less than thirty (30) days from the date one Member provides written notice of the dispute to the other(s). If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, the Members agree to submit the dispute to non-binding mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediator or, failing agreement, by a reputable mediation service in [State], in accordance with its then-current Commercial Mediation Procedures. The costs of mediation shall be borne equally by the Members involved in the dispute.</p>\n<p>If the dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days after the commencement of mediation, or such other period as the Members may agree in writing, the dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, unless the amount in controversy exceeds [Threshold Amount, e.g., $1,000,000], in which case three (3) arbitrators shall be appointed. The seat of the arbitration shall be [City, State], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that a court in [State] could grant, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and specific performance. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\n<h2>Signatures</h2>\n<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Members, intending to be legally bound, have executed this Operating Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above, thereby acknowledging their full understanding, acceptance, and agreement to all terms, conditions, rights, and obligations set forth herein.

This Agreement sets forth the rights, duties, and obligations of the Members concerning the Company's business and affairs, including but not limited to, the management, operation, and dissolution of the Company, as well as the respective ownership interests and financial rights of each Member.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">The Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of [State] by the filing of its Articles of Organization with the [State] Secretary of State on [Date of Filing]. This Agreement is intended to govern the internal affairs of the Company and the conduct of its business, superseding any prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the Company. All Members hereby agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein, acknowledging their full understanding of the implications of this legally binding document.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE I: DEFINITIONS</h2>\n        <p>\n            For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n            \"Capital Contribution\" means the total amount of cash, property, or services contributed by a Member to the Company as set forth in Article III.\n            \"Company\" means [LLC NAME], LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of [State].\n            \"Manager\" means a person or persons designated by the Members to manage the Company's business and affairs, if the Company is manager-managed.\n            \"Member\" means each person or entity who is a signatory to this Agreement or who is hereafter admitted as a member of the Company in accordance with the terms hereof.\n            \"Membership Interest\" means a Member's share of the profits and losses of the Company and the right to receive distributions of the Company's assets, as well as the right to vote on matters as provided herein.\n            \"Operating Agreement\" means this document, as it may be amended from time to time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            These definitions are crucial for interpreting the rights and obligations detailed throughout this Agreement, ensuring clarity and consistency in its application. Any term not specifically defined herein shall be interpreted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the [State] Limited Liability Company Act, as amended from time to time. The consistent application of these defined terms is essential for the proper governance and operation of the Company, preventing ambiguity in legal and financial matters.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE II: FORMATION AND PURPOSE</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Company was organized on [Date of Filing] by filing Articles of Organization with the Secretary of State of the State of [State] pursuant to the [State] Limited Liability Company Act. The name of the Company is [LLC NAME], LLC, and its principal place of business shall be located at [Company Address] or such other location as the Members may determine from time to time. The registered agent for service of process is [Registered Agent Name] located at [Registered Agent Address].\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The purpose of the Company is to engage in [Describe Business Purpose, e.g., \"any lawful act or activity for which a limited liability company may be organized under the laws of the State of [State], including but not limited to [Specific Business Activities, e.g., real estate investment, software development, consulting services]\"]. The Company shall have all powers necessary or convenient to effectuate its purposes, including the power to acquire, own, and dispose of real and personal property, enter into contracts, and incur indebtedness, all in furtherance of its stated business objectives.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE III: CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>\n        <p>\n            Each Member shall make an initial Capital Contribution to the Company as set forth in Schedule A attached hereto, which Schedule A shall be incorporated herein by reference. Such contributions may consist of cash, property, or services, as agreed upon by all Members. The fair market value of any non-cash contribution shall be determined by mutual agreement of all Members at the time of contribution, and such valuation shall be binding upon all Members for purposes of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            No Member shall be required to make any additional Capital Contributions to the Company beyond their initial contribution, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by all Members. In the event additional Capital Contributions are deemed necessary for the Company's operations, the Members shall vote on such necessity, and any approved additional contributions shall be made pro rata based on each Member's then-current Membership Interest, unless otherwise unanimously agreed. Failure of a Member to make an approved additional Capital Contribution may result in dilution of their Membership Interest or other remedies as determined by the non-defaulting Members.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE IV: MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS AND OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGES</h2>\n        <p>\n            Each Member's Membership Interest in the Company shall be expressed as a percentage, representing their share of the Company's profits, losses, and distributions. The initial Membership Interests of the Members shall be as set forth in Schedule A. These percentages shall be adjusted periodically to reflect any additional Capital Contributions, withdrawals, or transfers of Membership Interests made in accordance with this Agreement, ensuring that the aggregate of all Membership Interests always equals one hundred percent (100%).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The allocation of profits and losses for tax purposes shall be made in proportion to each Member's Membership Interest, unless otherwise required by applicable tax laws or regulations. Any adjustments to a Member's Capital Account, whether due to contributions, distributions, or allocations of profits and losses, shall be maintained in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). No Member shall have the right to demand or receive property other than cash in return for their Capital Contribution, except as specifically provided in this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE V: DISTRIBUTIONS</h2>\n        <p>\n            Distributions of the Company's available cash or other assets shall be made to the Members at such times and in such amounts as the Members or Manager(s) may determine, subject to the availability of funds and the Company's financial obligations. All distributions shall be made to the Members pro rata in accordance with their respective Membership Interests, unless otherwise unanimously agreed upon by all Members. No distribution shall be made if, after giving effect to the distribution, the Company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or the Company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Members acknowledge that the timing and amount of distributions are discretionary and dependent on the Company's financial performance, cash flow, and strategic needs. The Company shall maintain appropriate reserves for working capital, contingencies, and future business expansion as deemed necessary by the Members or Manager(s). Any amounts withheld from distribution for such purposes shall be clearly documented and communicated to all Members, ensuring transparency in financial management.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VI: MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Company shall be [Member-managed / Manager-managed]. If Member-managed, all Members shall have the authority to participate in the management and control of the Company's business and affairs. If Manager-managed, the Company shall be managed by one or more Managers, who may or may not be Members, as elected by the Members. The initial Manager(s) shall be [Name(s) of Manager(s)], who shall serve until their successors are elected or appointed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Decisions regarding the ordinary course of business shall require the approval of a [Simple Majority / Supermajority / All] of the Membership Interests. Major decisions, including but not limited to, amendments to this Agreement, admission of new Members, dissolution of the Company, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, or incurring indebtedness above [Threshold Amount], shall require the unanimous written consent of all Members. Regular meetings of the Members/Managers shall be held at least [Frequency, e.g., quarterly], with proper notice given to all participants, to discuss the Company's operations, financial performance, and future strategies.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VII: INDEMNIFICATION</h2>\n        <p>\n            To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of [State], the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Member, Manager, officer, or employee (each, an \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, and losses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Party in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred by this Agreement, provided such act or omission does not constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a knowing violation of law.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The right to indemnification provided herein shall include the right to be paid by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided that the Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. This indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled under any statute, agreement, or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a Member, Manager, officer, or employee.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VIII: CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\n        <p>\n            Each Member acknowledges that during the course of their involvement with the Company, they may acquire or have access to confidential and proprietary information concerning the Company's business, operations, financial affairs, trade secrets, customer lists, and strategic plans (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). Each Member agrees to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to disclose, disseminate, or use such information for any purpose other than for the benefit of the Company, without the prior written consent of the Company.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This confidentiality obligation shall survive the termination of a Member's association with the Company for a period of [Number] years following such termination. Excluded from \"Confidential Information\" is information that is generally available to the public, becomes known to a Member from a third party not bound by a confidentiality agreement, or is required to be disclosed by law. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Article, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, without the necessity of posting a bond.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE IX: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>\n        <p>\n            All intellectual property, including but not limited to, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and proprietary information, developed, conceived, or reduced to practice by any Member or employee in the course of their duties for the Company or with the use of Company resources, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Each Member agrees to promptly disclose to the Company any such intellectual property and to execute any and all documents necessary to assign full ownership rights to the Company.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the event any Member contributes existing intellectual property to the Company as part of their Capital Contribution or otherwise, such Member warrants that they have all necessary rights to grant the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license (or assignment, as applicable) to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense such intellectual property for the Company's business purposes. The Members further agree to cooperate fully with the Company in obtaining and enforcing any intellectual property rights worldwide.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE X: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>\n        <p>\n            The liability of each Member for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of the Company shall be limited solely to the amount of their Capital Contribution and their share of any undistributed profits, as provided by the [State] Limited Liability Company Act. No Member shall be personally liable for any debts, obligations, or liabilities of the Company beyond their Capital Contribution, except as expressly provided by law or as otherwise agreed in writing by such Member.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall protect any Member from liability for their own gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty. This limitation of liability is intended to afford the Members the maximum protection available under the laws of the State of [State] for limited liability companies, ensuring that their personal assets are shielded from the Company's obligations.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE XI: TERMINATION</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Company shall have perpetual existence unless dissolved earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Article. The Company shall be dissolved upon the unanimous written consent of all Members, or upon the occurrence of any event that makes it unlawful or impossible to carry on the business of the Company as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The death, resignation, expulsion, bankruptcy, or dissolution of any Member shall not, in and of itself, cause the dissolution of the Company, and the Company shall continue its existence unless otherwise determined by the remaining Members.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Upon dissolution, the Company shall immediately commence winding up its affairs. The assets of the Company shall be liquidated, and the proceeds shall be applied and distributed in the following order: (a) to the payment of all debts and liabilities of the Company, including expenses of liquidation; (b) to the establishment of any reserves deemed necessary by the Members for contingent liabilities; and (c) to the Members in proportion to their positive Capital Account balances, after taking into account all allocations and distributions. A final statement of account shall be prepared and furnished to all Members.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE XII: GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [State], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall first be subjected to good faith negotiation between the parties involved. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within [Number] days, the parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within [Number] days of the first mediation session, then the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration in [City, State] in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees in connection with any such arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE XIII: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h2>\n        <p>\n            **13.1 Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Members with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Members with respect to such subject matter. No oral representations, inducements, promises, or agreements, or otherwise, between the Members not embodied herein, shall be of any force or effect.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            **13.2 Amendments.** This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by all Members. Any amendment or modification must clearly state the intention to amend this Agreement and be signed by all parties to be legally binding. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            **13.3 Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            **13.4 Notices.** All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally, sent by recognized overnight courier, or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the addresses of the Members as set forth in Schedule A, or to such other address as any party may designate by notice to the others.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            **13.5 Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile or electronic signatures shall be deemed original for all purposes.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>SIGNATURES</h2>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Members have executed this Operating Agreement as of the date first above written.</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5in;\">___________________________________</p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\"><strong>[Member 1 Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\">Member</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5in;\">___________________________________</p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\"><strong>[Member 2 Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\">Member</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5in;\">___________________________________</p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\"><strong>[Member 3 Name, if applicable]</strong></p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\">Member</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5in;\">___________________________________</p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\"><strong>[Member 4 Name, if applicable]</strong></p>\n                    <p class=\"no-indent\">Member</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n        <br clear=\"all\" style=\"page-break-before:always\" />\n\n        <h2>SCHEDULE A: CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS</h2>\n\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">This Schedule A is incorporated by reference into the Operating Agreement of [LLC NAME], LLC, dated [Day] day of [Month], [Year].</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 33%; border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\"><strong>Member Name</strong></td>\n                <td style=\"width: 33%; border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\"><strong>Initial Capital Contribution</strong></td>\n                <td style=\"width: 34%; border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\"><strong>Membership Interest (%)</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Member 1 Name]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">$[Amount] (Cash) / [Description of Property/Services]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Percentage]%</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Member 2 Name]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">$[Amount] (Cash) / [Description of Property/Services]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Percentage]%</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Member 3 Name, if applicable]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">$[Amount] (Cash) / [Description of Property/Services]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Percentage]%</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Member 4 Name, if applicable]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">$[Amount] (Cash) / [Description of Property/Services]</td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\">[Percentage]%</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt; text-align: right;\"><strong>TOTAL:</strong></td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\"></td>\n                <td style=\"border: 1pt solid black; padding: 8pt;\"><strong>100%</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Shareholders' Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:</p>\n<p><strong>\"Agreement\"</strong> means this Shareholders' Agreement, including all schedules and appendices attached hereto, as may be amended, restated, or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Corporation\"</strong> or <strong>\"Company\"</strong> means [Full Legal Name of Corporation], a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of [Jurisdiction of Incorporation], and its successors and permitted assigns.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Shares\"</strong> means all shares of the capital stock of the Corporation, including without limitation, Common Shares, Preferred Shares, and any other class or series of shares, whether now outstanding or hereafter issued, and any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares, or any options, warrants, or other rights to acquire such shares.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Shareholder\"</strong> means any person or entity holding Shares in the Corporation and who is a party to this Agreement, as listed in Schedule A hereto, and any permitted transferee or assignee of such Shares who becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Board of Directors\"</strong> or <strong>\"Board\"</strong> means the duly constituted board of directors of the Corporation, as established and governed by the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Effective Date\"</strong> means [Effective Date], the date upon which this Agreement becomes effective and binding upon all parties hereto.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Exit Event\"</strong> means any transaction or series of transactions resulting in the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, a merger, amalgamation, or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity where the Shareholders immediately prior to such transaction do not hold a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity, or an initial public offering of the Corporation's Shares on a recognized stock exchange.</p>\n<h2>2. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>Each Shareholder (the \"Receiving Party\") acknowledges that in connection with this Agreement and their relationship with [Corporation Name] (the \"Corporation\") and other Shareholders (the \"Disclosing Parties\"), they may obtain or have access to confidential and proprietary information, including but not limited to, trade secrets, financial data, business plans, customer lists, marketing strategies, product development information, intellectual property, and other non-public information concerning the business and operations of the Corporation or the Disclosing Parties (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). The Receiving Party agrees to maintain the strict confidentiality of all such Confidential Information and shall not, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, or permit the disclosure of any Confidential Information to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or with the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party or the Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party or the Corporation; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided that the Receiving Party gives prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party or the Corporation prior to such disclosure to allow them to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Each Shareholder further agrees to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of Confidential Information, exercising at least the same degree of care as they use to protect their own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care. These confidentiality obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.</p>\n<h2>3. Warranties</h2>\n<p>Each Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to the Corporation and to each other Shareholder, as of the Effective Date and throughout the term of this Agreement, that:</p>\n<p>(a) Such Shareholder has the full legal capacity, power, and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other organizational action on the part of such Shareholder.</p>\n<p>(b) This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation of such Shareholder, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.</p>\n<p>(c) The execution, delivery, and performance by such Shareholder of this Agreement do not and will not violate or conflict with any provision of its organizational documents, any agreement, instrument, judgment, order, or decree to which such Shareholder is a party or by which it is bound, or any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>\n<p>(d) All shares of the Corporation held by such Shareholder are, and will remain, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable, and are held free and clear of any liens, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, options, charges, or adverse claims, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed in writing to the Corporation and other Shareholders prior to the Effective Date.</p>\n<p>(e) All information provided by such Shareholder to the Corporation or other Shareholders in connection with this Agreement is true, accurate, and complete in all material respects and does not omit any material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.</p>\n<h2>4. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>Each Shareholder (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, the other Shareholders, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (each, an \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Indemnified Party, arising out of or resulting from any breach by the Indemnifying Party of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement. This indemnification obligation shall not apply to the extent that any such loss arises out of or results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party.</p>\n<p>In the event of any claim for which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such claim; provided, however, that the failure to give prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to assume the defense of any third-party claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party within [Number] days after receipt of notice of such claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense, the Indemnified Party may defend the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith.</p>\n<p>The indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the transfer of any Shares for a period of [Number] years from the date of such termination or transfer, or, if longer, for the applicable statute of limitations period, ensuring that all claims arising prior to such expiration are fully addressed.</p>\n<h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, no Shareholder, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, or agents (collectively, \"Related Parties\"), shall be liable to any other Shareholder or to the Corporation for any loss, damage, or expense arising from any act or omission in connection with this Agreement or the business of the Corporation, provided such act or omission was made in good faith and in the belief that such act or omission was in the best interests of the Corporation and its Shareholders, and did not constitute gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or a material breach of this Agreement or any fiduciary duty owed by such Shareholder or Related Party.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any Shareholder or their Related Parties be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunity, or loss of goodwill, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the operations of [Corporation Name], regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if such Shareholder or Related Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The aggregate liability of any Shareholder and their Related Parties under this Agreement for any and all claims, losses, or damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to the aggregate value of the shares held by such Shareholder in [Corporation Name] as of the date of the claim, excluding any liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<h2>6. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of the following events, unless otherwise expressly provided herein:</p>\n<p>(a) The unanimous written agreement of all Shareholders then party to this Agreement, clearly expressing their mutual intent to terminate this Agreement, duly executed by each such Shareholder;</p>\n<p>(b) The dissolution, winding-up, or bankruptcy of the Corporation, [Corporation Name], in accordance with the applicable corporate laws of [Jurisdiction of Incorporation], provided that all assets have been distributed and the Corporation has ceased to exist as a legal entity;</p>\n<p>(c) The completion of a Qualified Public Offering (as defined in Section [Relevant Section Number, e.g., 9.3 - Exit Provisions]) of the Corporation's shares on a recognized stock exchange, provided that all shares held by the Shareholders party to this Agreement have been sold or converted into publicly traded securities in connection with such offering;</p>\n<p>(d) The completion of a Change of Control Transaction (as defined in Section [Relevant Section Number, e.g., 9.4 - Exit Provisions]) where all shares held by the Shareholders party to this Agreement are acquired by a third party or parties not previously party to this Agreement, and such acquisition results in the complete divestiture of all original Shareholder interests.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing termination events, the provisions of Section [e.g., 10. Confidentiality], Section [e.g., 11. Indemnification], Section [e.g., 12. Governing Law], and Section [e.g., 13. Dispute Resolution] shall survive any termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect indefinitely or for the period specified therein, as applicable. Upon termination, the parties shall be released from their obligations hereunder, save for any obligations or liabilities that accrued prior to the effective date of termination.</p>\n<h2>7. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing State/Country], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing State/Country] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [Governing State/Country]. The parties irrevocably agree that the federal and state courts located in [Governing Jurisdiction] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p>\n<p>Each party hereby waives any objection to venue in such courts and irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action or proceeding and to the service of process by mail. The parties acknowledge and agree that this choice of law and forum is reasonable and fair, and that they will not assert any defense of forum non conveniens or similar defense in any action or proceeding brought in such courts.</p>\n<h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>\n    Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between the Parties. A Party shall provide written notice of the dispute to the other Parties, and the Parties shall endeavor to resolve the dispute amicably within thirty (30) days of such notice.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, the Parties agree to endeavor to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be administered by [Mediation Institution, e.g., JAMS or the American Arbitration Association (AAA)] in accordance with its then-current Mediation Rules. The mediation shall take place in [City, State, Country], and the costs of the mediation shall be borne equally by the Parties, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of the commencement of mediation, or if one Party declines to participate in mediation, the dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by [Arbitration Institution, e.g., the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or AAA] in accordance with its [Specific Arbitration Rules, e.g., Rules of Arbitration or Commercial Arbitration Rules] then in effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The arbitration shall be conducted by [one/three] arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be [City, State, Country], and the language of the arbitration shall be [Language, e.g., English]. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties hereby waive any right to appeal the arbitration award, to the extent permitted by law.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8 shall prevent any Party from seeking immediate injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for matters involving intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or the enforcement of any judgment or award, where such relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm and where monetary damages alone would be an insufficient remedy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Parties agree that all arbitration proceedings and awards shall be kept confidential, except as required by law or as necessary for the enforcement of the award. The prevailing Party in any arbitration or judicial proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs (including, without limitation, expert witness fees and arbitration/court costs) from the non-prevailing Party.\n</p>\n<h2>9.

Each signatory warrants and represents that they possess the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to bind the entity or individual for whom they are signing to the terms and conditions contained herein.

This definition encompasses any and all equity interests, options, warrants, or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares, representing ownership in the Company, and includes any future subdivisions, consolidations, or reclassifications thereof.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            \"Board\" or \"Board of Directors\" refers to the duly constituted board of directors of the Company, responsible for the overall governance and strategic direction of the Company. \"Confidential Information\" means all non-public information, whether commercial, financial, technical, operational, or otherwise, disclosed by one Party to another, or otherwise obtained by a Party in connection with the Company's business, which is marked as confidential or which, by its nature, would reasonably be understood to be confidential.

Any new issuance of shares shall be subject to the pre-emptive rights of existing Shareholders as detailed in Section 6, ensuring that each Shareholder has the opportunity to maintain their proportionate ownership interest in the Company.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Board of Directors of the Company shall consist of a minimum of [Number] and a maximum of [Number] directors. Shareholder 1 shall have the right to designate [Number] director(s) to the Board, and Shareholder 2 shall have the right to designate [Number] director(s) to the Board.

The Board shall be responsible for the strategic oversight and governance of the Company, including but not limited to, approving annual budgets, major capital expenditures, and the appointment of senior management. A quorum for any Board meeting shall be [Number] directors, and resolutions shall be passed by a simple majority vote of directors present, unless otherwise specified herein or in the Company's bylaws.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>4. VOTING RIGHTS</h2>\n        <p>\n            Except as otherwise provided in the Company's Articles of Incorporation or this Agreement, all resolutions requiring Shareholder approval shall be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast by the Common Shares and Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class. However, certain \"Reserved Matters,\" as defined below, shall require the affirmative vote of Shareholders holding at least [Percentage]% of the Common Shares and [Percentage]% of the Preferred Shares, voting as separate classes, or the unanimous written consent of all Shareholders.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Reserved Matters shall include, but not be limited to, any amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, any issuance of new shares, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, incurrence of indebtedness exceeding $[Amount], or the declaration of any dividends. Any action taken by the Company or the Board concerning a Reserved Matter without the requisite Shareholder approval shall be null and void and of no effect.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>5. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Company shall, at the discretion of the Board, declare and pay dividends or make other distributions to its Shareholders, subject to applicable law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation. Preferred Shareholders shall have a preference in the payment of dividends at the rate specified in Section 2 before any dividends are paid to Common Shareholders. Any declaration of dividends shall be made in accordance with the Company's financial performance and cash flow projections, ensuring the Company retains sufficient working capital for its operations and growth initiatives.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Board shall review the Company's financial position at least annually to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of declaring dividends. Notwithstanding any other provision, no dividends or distributions shall be declared or paid if, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, such payment would render the Company insolvent or would cause the Company to be in breach of any loan covenants or other material contractual obligations. Any dividends declared shall be paid pro rata to the holders of each class of shares entitled thereto, based on their respective shareholdings.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND EXIT TERMS</h2>\n        <p>\n            No Shareholder shall sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any Shares in the Company without strict compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Before any Shareholder (the \"Selling Shareholder\") can transfer Shares to a third party, the Selling Shareholder must first offer such Shares to the other Shareholders (the \"Non-Selling Shareholders\") in accordance with a right of first refusal. The Non-Selling Shareholders shall have [Number] days to elect to purchase their pro rata portion of the offered shares at the price and on the terms offered by the third party.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the event that a third party offers to purchase all or substantially all of the shares of the Company (a \"Drag-Along Event\"), and Shareholders holding at least [Percentage]% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares and [Percentage]% of the issued and outstanding Preferred Shares agree to such sale, then all other Shareholders shall be obligated to sell all of their shares on the same terms and conditions as the selling Shareholders. Conversely, if a Selling Shareholder proposes to sell shares to a third party, the Non-Selling Shareholders shall have the right (a \"Tag-Along Right\") to participate in such sale on a pro rata basis and on the same terms and conditions as the Selling Shareholder.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\n        <p>\n            Each Shareholder acknowledges that, in connection with their ownership of Shares and participation in the Company's affairs, they may obtain or have access to Confidential Information. Each Shareholder agrees to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and not to disclose, disseminate, or use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the benefit of the Company, without the prior written consent of the Company or as required by law. This obligation of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the Shareholder's ownership of Shares.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving Shareholder; (b) was already in the receiving Shareholder's possession prior to disclosure by the Company, without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (c) is independently developed by the receiving Shareholder without use of or reference to the Company's Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided that the receiving Shareholder gives prompt notice to the Company prior to such disclosure.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8.

The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.</p>\n<p>The Corporation shall have the power to pay expenses incurred by any such person in defending any such action, suit, or proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in these Bylaws. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Section 7 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.</p>\n<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of [State], no director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the liability of a director or officer for: (i) any breach of the director's or officer's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) unlawful distributions, loans, or guarantees made in violation of Section [Applicable State Statute Number, e.g., 170.062] of the [State] General Corporation Law; or (iv) any transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit. The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of the State of [State], including the advancement of expenses, against all liability and expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding arising out of their status as directors or officers, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.</p>\n<h2>9.

In the event of such termination, [Client Party] shall pay [Party A] for all services rendered and expenses reasonably incurred up to the effective date of termination, calculated on a pro-rata basis according to the agreed-upon fee schedule, in addition to any non-cancellable commitments made by [Party A] in reliance on this Agreement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.3 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon the effective date of termination for any reason, [Party A] shall immediately cease all work related to the drafting of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and [Client Party] shall promptly pay all outstanding fees and expenses due up to the termination date.

This name shall be used consistently in all corporate filings, communications, and legal instruments. The corporation reserves the right to change its name in accordance with applicable Delaware law and these Articles, provided such change is properly approved by the Board of Directors and, if required, by the stockholders, and duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware.</p>\n        <p>The chosen name is intended to clearly identify the entity and distinguish it from other corporations registered in the State of Delaware. Any future amendments to this Article I must adhere strictly to the procedural requirements for amending Articles of Incorporation as set forth in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, including the necessity of a board resolution and, where applicable, a stockholder vote, followed by the filing of a Certificate of Amendment.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE II: REGISTERED AGENT AND OFFICE</h2>\n        <p>The address of the corporation's registered office in the State of Delaware is [REGISTERED OFFICE ADDRESS, e.g., 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801]. The name of its registered agent at such address is [REGISTERED AGENT NAME, e.g., The Corporation Trust Company]. This registered office and agent are designated for the purpose of receiving service of process and official notices on behalf of the corporation, ensuring compliance with statutory requirements for maintaining a presence within the state of incorporation.</p>\n        <p>The corporation shall maintain a registered agent and registered office in Delaware at all times as required by the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Any change in the registered agent or registered office must be effected by filing a Certificate of Change of Registered Agent and/or Registered Office with the Secretary of State of Delaware. Failure to maintain a valid registered agent and office may result in the forfeiture of the corporation's corporate status or other penalties under Delaware law.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE III: PURPOSE</h2>\n        <p>The purpose of the corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware. This broad purpose clause grants the corporation maximum flexibility to pursue various business ventures and activities without the need for frequent amendments to its Articles of Incorporation, encompassing any and all commercial, financial, or other lawful undertakings that the Board of Directors deems appropriate and beneficial to the corporation and its stockholders.</p>\n        <p>This general purpose clause is intended to be interpreted expansively, allowing the corporation to adapt to changing market conditions and pursue new opportunities without statutory limitations on its scope of operations. While the corporation may initially focus on specific activities, this clause ensures that it is not restricted from expanding into new industries or engaging in diverse business operations, provided such activities remain lawful and are conducted in accordance with the corporation's bylaws and applicable legal and regulatory frameworks.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE IV: AUTHORIZED SHARES</h2>\n        <p>The total number of shares of stock which the corporation shall have authority to issue is [NUMBER, e.g., 10,000,000] shares of Common Stock, each with a par value of [PAR VALUE, e.g., $0.0001] per share. All shares of Common Stock shall be of one class and shall have equal rights, preferences, and privileges in all respects, including voting rights, dividend rights, and liquidation preferences, unless otherwise specified in a Certificate of Designations filed for any future series of preferred stock.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors is expressly authorized, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to issue shares of Common Stock from time to time for such consideration as the Board may deem appropriate. The Board may also, by resolution, establish and designate one or more series of Preferred Stock, and fix the number of shares and the relative rights, preferences, and limitations of each such series, without further stockholder approval, provided such actions are consistent with the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations set forth in these Articles or the Bylaws.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE V: INCORPORATOR</h2>\n        <p>The name and mailing address of the incorporator are: [INCORPORATOR NAME], [INCORPORATOR ADDRESS]. The incorporator's sole duty in this capacity is to execute and file these Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware. Upon the filing of these Articles, the corporate existence shall commence, and the incorporator's role shall largely conclude, transferring authority to the initial Board of Directors.</p>\n        <p>Following the effectiveness of these Articles, the incorporator shall take all necessary steps to organize the corporation, which typically includes holding an organizational meeting to adopt bylaws, elect initial directors, and transact any other business necessary to complete the organization of the corporation. The incorporator may then resign, and the corporation will proceed under the governance of its Board of Directors and officers.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VI: LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY</h2>\n        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as it now exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. This provision is intended to provide directors with robust protection against personal liability for actions taken in good faith in their corporate capacity, thereby encouraging qualified individuals to serve on the Board.</p>\n        <p>This Article VI shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to unlawful dividends or stock repurchases), or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VII: EFFECTIVE DATE</h2>\n        <p>These Articles of Incorporation shall become effective upon the date of filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date as may be specified herein, not to exceed 90 days from the date of filing. The filing date marks the official commencement of the corporation's legal existence and its recognition as a distinct legal entity under Delaware law, enabling it to commence business operations and enter into contracts.</p>\n        <p>The effective date signifies the point at which the corporation acquires all the rights, powers, and privileges of a duly organized Delaware corporation. From this date forward, the corporation is subject to all applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, its own Articles of Incorporation, and its Bylaws, and is authorized to issue shares, elect directors, and conduct its affairs as a corporate entity.</p>\n\n        <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned incorporator has executed these Articles of Incorporation this [DAY] day of [MONTH], [YEAR].</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <div class=\"signature-line\"></div>\n                    <p class=\"signature-name\">[INCORPORATOR NAME]</p>\n                    <p>Incorporator</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\"></td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n        <div style=\"page-break-before: always;\"></div>\n\n        <h1>BYLAWS<br>OF [CORPORATION NAME]</h1>\n\n        <p>These Bylaws govern the internal affairs of [CORPORATION NAME] (the \"Corporation\"), a corporation organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and are adopted by the Incorporator or the initial Board of Directors to establish the rules and procedures for the Corporation's operation, management, and governance. They are subordinate to the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and the General Corporation Law of Delaware, and in the event of any conflict, the Articles of Incorporation or applicable law shall prevail.</p>\n        <p>These Bylaws may be amended, altered, or repealed, and new Bylaws may be adopted, in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All actions taken by the Corporation, its directors, officers, and stockholders shall be in strict compliance with these Bylaws, ensuring orderly and lawful conduct of corporate business and the protection of stakeholder interests. Any interpretation of these Bylaws shall be consistent with the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and the General Corporation Law of Delaware.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE I: CORPORATE NAME AND OFFICE</h2>\n        <h3>Section 1.1. Name.</h3>\n        <p>The name of the Corporation is [CORPORATION NAME]. This name shall be used for all legal and business purposes, and any change to this name must be effected through an amendment to the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware, as well as an update to these Bylaws. The Corporation shall ensure that its name is clearly displayed on all official documents and at its principal place of business.</p>\n        <p>The Corporation shall operate under this name and maintain its legal identity as established by its Articles of Incorporation. All contracts, agreements, and other legal instruments entered into by the Corporation shall clearly identify the Corporation by its full legal name, ensuring proper legal recognition and enforceability.

This location serves as the primary administrative and operational center for the Corporation's business activities, where its main records are typically maintained.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors has the authority to change the principal office location as deemed necessary for the efficient operation of the Corporation, provided that proper notice is given to relevant parties and any required regulatory filings are made. Such a change does not necessitate an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, but it may require updates to various corporate records and communications to reflect the new address.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE II: SHAREHOLDERS</h2>\n        <h3>Section 2.1. Annual Meetings.</h3>\n        <p>An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held each year at such date, time, and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated by the Board of Directors. The primary purpose of the annual meeting shall be for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting. Failure to hold the annual meeting at the designated time shall not work any forfeiture or dissolution of the Corporation.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors shall provide reasonable notice of the annual meeting to all stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with these Bylaws and applicable law. Business transacted at the annual meeting shall be limited to those matters set forth in the notice of meeting or matters otherwise properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws and the rules of procedure adopted by the Board of Directors. The Board may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled annual meeting.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 2.2. Special Meetings.</h3>\n        <p>Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by the Board of Directors, the President, or by the holders of not less than [PERCENTAGE, e.g., twenty percent (20%)] of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting. The call for a special meeting shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and the business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice of the meeting.</p>\n        <p>Upon receipt of a written request for a special meeting from eligible stockholders, the Secretary shall promptly call such meeting to be held at a reasonable time and date. The Board of Directors shall determine the location of any special meeting, which may be held within or without the State of Delaware. Notice of any special meeting shall be given in the same manner as for annual meetings, specifying the purpose of the meeting.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 2.3. Notice of Meetings.</h3>\n        <p>Written notice of the annual meeting or any special meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice may be given personally, by mail, or by electronic transmission.</p>\n        <p>If mailed, notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If sent by electronic transmission, notice shall be deemed given when directed to the stockholder's electronic mail address. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 2.4. Quorum.</h3>\n        <p>Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders. If a quorum is not present, the meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy, without further notice other than announcement at the meeting.</p>\n        <p>Once a quorum is established at a meeting, it shall not be broken by the subsequent withdrawal of stockholders from the meeting. Unless otherwise required by law or the Articles of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall be treated as shares present for quorum purposes but not as votes cast for or against a proposal.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 2.5. Voting.</h3>\n        <p>Each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. All elections of directors shall be by plurality vote. All other matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, unless a different vote is required by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws. Voting may be by voice vote or by ballot as determined by the chairperson of the meeting.</p>\n        <p>Stockholders may vote in person or by proxy.

The Board of Directors may establish procedures for the receipt and validation of proxies, including electronic proxies, consistent with Delaware law.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE III: BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h2>\n        <h3>Section 3.1. Number, Election, Term.</h3>\n        <p>The number of directors constituting the entire Board shall be not less than [MINIMUM NUMBER, e.g., one (1)] nor more than [MAXIMUM NUMBER, e.g., nine (9)], as determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders. The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation, removal, or death.</p>\n        <p>Directors need not be stockholders. The Board of Directors may, by resolution, establish different classes of directors with staggered terms, if permitted by the Articles of Incorporation and Delaware law. Each director shall perform their duties in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 3.2. Powers.</h3>\n        <p>The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board shall have all powers necessary or appropriate for the management of the Corporation's business, including but not limited to, the power to elect officers, declare dividends, authorize the issuance of stock, incur indebtedness, and adopt, amend, or repeal Bylaws, subject to any limitations in the Articles of Incorporation or Delaware law. The Board may delegate certain powers to committees or officers, but ultimate oversight responsibility remains with the Board.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the Corporation, overseeing its financial performance, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Directors are fiduciaries of the Corporation and its stockholders, and their decisions must be made with due care and loyalty. The Board may establish policies and procedures for the conduct of the Corporation's business, and may retain advisors as necessary to assist in its duties.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 3.3. Meetings.</h3>\n        <p>Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such times and places, within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board may from time to time determine. Special meetings of the Board may be called by the President, the Chairman of the Board, or by any two directors, on at least two (2) days' notice to each director, either personally, by mail, or by electronic transmission. Notice of regular meetings need not be given if the time and place are fixed by resolution of the Board.</p>\n        <p>Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this provision shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. The Board may also act without a meeting if all directors consent in writing to such action, as further detailed in these Bylaws.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 3.4. Quorum.</h3>\n        <p>At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board, the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. No business requiring a vote shall be transacted in the absence of a quorum.</p>\n        <p>The act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless a greater number is required by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws. Directors may not vote by proxy at Board meetings. Any director who has a conflict of interest in a matter under consideration should recuse themselves from the discussion and vote on that matter, in accordance with the Corporation's conflict of interest policy.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE IV: OFFICERS</h2>\n        <h3>Section 4.1. Number and Titles.</h3>\n        <p>The officers of the Corporation shall consist of a President, a Secretary, and a Treasurer. The Board of Directors may also elect or appoint such other officers, including a Chairman of the Board, one or more Vice Presidents, Assistant Secretaries, and Assistant Treasurers, as it may deem desirable. Any number of offices may be held by the same person, unless prohibited by law or the Articles of Incorporation. The Board shall determine the duties and responsibilities of all officers.</p>\n        <p>The officers shall be elected by the Board of Directors at its first meeting following each annual meeting of stockholders, or as soon thereafter as convenient. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, create new officer positions or combine existing ones, and define their respective duties and authorities as necessary for the efficient management of the Corporation.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 4.2. Duties of Officers.</h3>\n        <p>The officers shall have such duties and responsibilities as are customarily incident to their respective offices and such other duties as may be assigned to them from time to time by the Board of Directors. The President shall be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and shall have general supervision over the business and affairs of the Corporation, subject to the control of the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall keep the minutes of all meetings of the stockholders and the Board of Directors, and shall be responsible for all corporate records and official correspondence. The Treasurer shall have custody of the corporate funds and securities and shall keep full and accurate accounts of receipts and disbursements.</p>\n        <p>Each officer shall perform their duties in a diligent and faithful manner, upholding the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. In the absence or disability of any officer, the Board of Directors may delegate the powers and duties of such officer to any other officer or to any director. The Board may also require officers to provide bonds for the faithful performance of their duties, in such sums and with such sureties as the Board may determine.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE V: INDEMNIFICATION</h2>\n        <h3>Section 5.1. Right to Indemnification.</h3>\n        <p>The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.</p>\n        <p>The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 5.2. Advancement of Expenses.</h3>\n        <p>Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit, or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by the person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article V. Such undertaking shall be an unlimited general obligation of the person receiving the advance and may be unsecured.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors shall have the authority to determine the terms and conditions under which such advancements are made, including the requirement for a written undertaking. This advancement of expenses is intended to ensure that directors and officers are not financially burdened during the pendency of litigation or investigations, thereby encouraging qualified individuals to serve the Corporation. The Corporation may also purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VI: CAPITAL STOCK</h2>\n        <h3>Section 6.1. Certificates.</h3>\n        <p>The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, or shall be uncertificated shares. Each certificate for shares shall be in such form as the Board of Directors may determine and shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President, or a Vice President and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer. The certificate shall state the name of the Corporation, that it is organized under the laws of Delaware, the name of the person to whom issued, and the number and class of shares represented thereby. All certificates shall bear the corporate seal or a facsimile thereof.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors may provide by resolution that some or all of any or all classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Any uncertificated shares shall be evidenced by a book-entry system maintained by the Corporation or its transfer agent, and a written statement shall be sent to the holder of such uncertificated shares within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of such shares, providing information required by Delaware law.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 6.2. Transfer of Shares.</h3>\n        <p>Transfers of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the holder of record thereof, or by his or her attorney thereunto duly authorized, upon surrender of the certificate or proper evidence of transfer for such shares, properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed stock power. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided by the laws of Delaware.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors may appoint a transfer agent and/or registrar to maintain the records of stock ownership and facilitate transfers. The Corporation shall not be obligated to transfer shares until any applicable restrictions on transfer, including those imposed by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or any agreements to which the Corporation is a party, have been satisfied. The Board may establish reasonable rules and regulations for the transfer of shares, consistent with applicable law and these Bylaws.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VII: GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>\n        <h3>Section 7.1. Corporate Seal.</h3>\n        <p>The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation and the words \"Corporate Seal, Delaware.\" The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise. The use of the corporate seal is not mandatory under Delaware law for the validity of corporate acts, but it may be used on official documents as a mark of authenticity and corporate authority.</p>\n        <p>The Secretary shall be the custodian of the corporate seal. The Board of Directors may authorize other officers to use the seal in connection with their duties. The absence of the corporate seal on any document shall not impair the validity of such document or the transaction contemplated thereby, provided the document is otherwise properly authorized and executed by the Corporation.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 7.2. Fiscal Year.</h3>\n        <p>The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined, the fiscal year shall end on the [MONTH AND DAY, e.g., 31st day of December] of each year. The fiscal year establishes the accounting period for the Corporation's financial reporting and tax purposes.</p>\n        <p>The Board of Directors may change the fiscal year at any time, provided that such change is properly documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders, including taxing authorities. Any change to the fiscal year must comply with applicable accounting standards and tax regulations, and may require adjustments to financial reporting cycles.</p>\n\n        <h3>Section 7.3. Waiver of Notice.</h3>\n        <p>Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.</p>\n        <p>Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. This provision allows for flexibility in meeting notice requirements, particularly in situations where all parties are aware of and consent to the meeting, ensuring that procedural technicalities do not unduly impede corporate actions.</p>\n\n        <h2>ARTICLE VIII: AMENDMENTS</h2>\n        <p>These Bylaws may be altered, amended, or repealed, and new Bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the Board, provided that notice of the proposed alteration, amendment, or repeal is contained in the notice of such meeting. The power to alter, amend, or repeal the Bylaws and to adopt new Bylaws is also vested in the stockholders, who may exercise such power at any annual or special meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon.</p>\n        <p>Any Bylaw adopted by the Board of Directors may be altered, amended, or repealed by the stockholders. Stockholders retain the ultimate authority over the Bylaws, ensuring that the Board's actions are subject to stockholder oversight. This dual amendment power provides flexibility for the Board to make necessary operational adjustments while preserving the stockholders' fundamental right to govern the Corporation's internal affairs. Any amendment must be consistent with the Articles of Incorporation and the General Corporation Law of Delaware.</p>\n\n        <p>ADOPTED by the Board of Directors on this [DAY] day of [MONTH], [YEAR].</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <div class=\"signature-line\"></div>\n                    <p class=\"signature-name\">[NAME OF PRESIDENT]</p>\n                    <p>President</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <div class=\"signature-line\"></div>\n                    <p class=\"signature-name\">[NAME OF SECRETARY]</p>\n                    <p>Secretary</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Employment Agreement (hereinafter, the \"Agreement\"), the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:</p>\n<p><strong>1.1 \"Agreement\"</strong> means this entire Employment Agreement, including all its schedules, appendices, and any amendments or addenda thereto, as may be executed by the Parties from time to time.</p>\n<p><strong>1.2 \"Employee\"</strong> refers to [Employee's Full Legal Name], the individual being employed under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>1.3 \"Employer\"</strong> refers to [Employer's Full Legal Name/Company Name], a [State of Incorporation/Jurisdiction] corporation/entity, with its principal place of business located at [Employer's Address].</p>\n<p><strong>1.4 \"Effective Date\"</strong> means [Effective Date], the date upon which this Agreement becomes legally binding and the Employee's employment with the Employer commences.</p>\n<p><strong>1.5 \"Confidential Information\"</strong> means any and all non-public information, data, or materials, whether tangible or intangible, disclosed by the Employer to the Employee, or otherwise obtained by the Employee during the course of employment, concerning the Employer's business, operations, products, services, customers, financial data, trade secrets, intellectual property, marketing plans, strategies, or personnel, including but not limited to, inventions, discoveries, designs, processes, formulas, software, algorithms, know-how, data, techniques, schematics, and customer lists. Confidential Information does not include information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Employee in violation of this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>1.6 \"Intellectual Property\"</strong> means all inventions, discoveries, designs, developments, improvements, trade secrets, processes, formulas, works of authorship, mask works, software, algorithms, data, databases, know-how, ideas, and other intellectual property rights, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by the Employee, either alone or with others, during the course of employment with the Employer and within the scope of the Employee's duties or relating to the Employer's business or demonstrably anticipated research and development.</p>\n<p><strong>1.7 \"Compensation\"</strong> refers collectively to the Base Salary, any applicable bonuses, and other benefits as detailed in Section [X.X] of this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>2. Term</h2>\n<p>This Employment Agreement (the \"Agreement\") shall commence on the date first written above, or if no date is specified, on the date [Employee] commences employment with [Employer] (the \"Effective Date\"). The employment relationship established by this Agreement is intended to be \"at-will\" employment, meaning that either [Employer] or [Employee] may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject only to the specific notice requirements, if any, and other explicit termination procedures detailed in Section [X. Termination] of this Agreement. This employment shall continue indefinitely until terminated by either party in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section [X. Termination] of this Agreement. This term provision does not create a contract of employment for a definite term or restrict [Employer]'s right to modify or terminate employment policies or practices, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>\n<p>\n    [Employee Name] shall receive a gross annual salary of [Gross Annual Salary] (e.g., USD $X), payable in [Payment Frequency] installments. Payments shall be made on the [Day of Week/Date] of each [Pay Period] via direct deposit to a bank account designated by [Employee Name]. All statutory deductions, including but not limited to federal, state, and local income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare contributions, along with any other deductions authorized by [Employee Name] or required by law (e.g., health insurance premiums, retirement plan contributions), shall be withheld from the gross salary.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For hours worked in excess of the standard [Number] hours per week, [Employee Name] shall be compensated for overtime at the rate of [Overtime Rate] per hour, in strict accordance with applicable federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition to the base salary, [Employee Name] may be eligible for discretionary bonuses or incentive payments based on [Bonus Criteria, e.g., individual performance, company profitability, achievement of specific targets], as determined by [Party A] in its sole discretion. Any such bonuses, if awarded, shall be paid on [Bonus Payment Schedule, e.g., annually, quarterly]. [Party A] reserves the right to review [Employee Name]'s salary at least annually, typically around [Month], to consider adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and company policy, although no increase is guaranteed.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>\n    During the course of [Employee Name]'s employment with [Company Name] (the \"Company\"), [Employee Name] will have access to and become acquainted with various confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information belonging to the Company and its clients, including but not limited to, business plans, financial data, marketing strategies, customer lists, pricing information, product development plans, software code, technical specifications, research and development data, employee information, and other non-public information (collectively, \"Confidential Information\").\n</p>\n<p>\n    [Employee Name] agrees to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, at any time during or after the term of employment, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of an authorized officer of the Company. This obligation of confidentiality extends to information received by the Company from others that the Company is obligated to treat as confidential.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The obligations of confidentiality set forth herein shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of [Employee Name]; (b) is rightfully received by [Employee Name] from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (c) is required to be disclosed by law, court order, or governmental regulation, provided that [Employee Name] provides prompt written notice to the Company prior to such disclosure to allow the Company an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Upon termination of employment for any reason, or at any time upon the Company's request, [Employee Name] shall immediately return to the Company all documents, records, notebooks, computer files, and any other tangible or intangible property containing Confidential Information, including all copies thereof, regardless of whether such information was prepared by [Employee Name] or others. [Employee Name] shall not retain any copies, notes, or abstracts of such Confidential Information.\n</p>\n<p>\n    [Employee Name] acknowledges that the unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to the Company, for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and therefore, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. This confidentiality obligation shall survive the termination of [Employee Name]'s employment with the Company indefinitely.\n</p>\n<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>\n    5.1. **Ownership of Intellectual Property.** [Employee Name] (\"Employee\") acknowledges and agrees that all inventions, discoveries, designs, developments, methods, processes, formulae, works of authorship, improvements, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (collectively, \"Intellectual Property\") that are conceived, made, developed, or reduced to practice by Employee, either alone or jointly with others, during the period of employment with [Company Name] (the \"Company\") and that relate to the Company's actual or anticipated business, research, or development, or that are made with the use of the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information, shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5.2. **Assignment of Rights.** Employee hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to any and all such Intellectual Property, including all worldwide copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, and other intellectual property rights therein. Employee further agrees that any copyrightable work created by Employee within the scope of employment shall be considered a \"work made for hire\" as defined under the United States Copyright Act, and to the extent it is not, Employee hereby assigns all copyright in such work to the Company.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5.3. **Disclosure and Cooperation.** Employee agrees to promptly disclose in writing to the Company all Intellectual Property covered by this Section 5. Employee further agrees to execute any and all applications, assignments, or other instruments that the Company deems necessary to apply for and obtain protection for such Intellectual Property in any country, and to vest the entire right, title, and interest in such Intellectual Property in the Company. Employee's obligation to assist the Company in obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights shall continue beyond the termination of employment.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5.4. **Prior Inventions.** Employee represents and warrants that the attached Schedule A (if any) contains a complete list of all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, improvements, and trade secrets that were made by Employee prior to the [Effective Date] and that belong to Employee or to a third party and are not assigned to the Company hereunder (\"Prior Inventions\"). If no Schedule A is attached, Employee represents that there are no such Prior Inventions. Employee agrees not to incorporate any Prior Inventions into any Company product, service, or process without the Company's prior written consent.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Termination</h2>\n<p>\n    This Employment Agreement (the \"Agreement\") may be terminated under the following conditions, subject to applicable law and the specific terms outlined herein:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>6.1.

Termination by [Employer Name] Without Cause:</strong> [Employer Name] may terminate this Agreement and [Employee Name]'s employment at any time without Cause, by providing [Employee Name] with [Notice Period, e.g., thirty (30) days'] written notice or, at [Employer Name]'s sole discretion, payment in lieu of such notice. In addition to any accrued but unpaid salary and benefits up to the date of termination, [Employee Name] shall be entitled to severance pay equivalent to [Number] weeks/months of base salary, payable in a lump sum or installments as determined by [Employer Name], provided [Employee Name] executes and does not revoke a general release of claims in a form satisfactory to [Employer Name] within the timeframe specified by law.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>6.3. Termination by [Employee Name]:</strong> [Employee Name] may terminate this Agreement and employment by providing [Employer Name] with [Notice Period, e.g., two (2) weeks'] written notice. During this notice period, [Employee Name] is expected to continue to perform all duties and responsibilities diligently and cooperate fully in the transition of responsibilities.

Final payment of wages and any other accrued benefits will be made in accordance with applicable state and federal law.\n</p>\n<h2>7. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Employment Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, its validity, interpretation, enforceability, and performance, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [State], [Country], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of [State]. The parties hereto expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. This choice of law provision is intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the governing law for this Agreement and all disputes arising hereunder.</p>\n<h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Employment Agreement, including but not limited to its formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity, or the employment relationship between [Employer Name] (the \"Company\") and [Employee Name] (the \"Employee\"), shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between the Parties. Should the Parties be unable to resolve the dispute through direct negotiation within thirty (30) days of one Party providing written notice of the dispute to the other, the Parties agree to engage in non-binding mediation with a mutually agreed-upon mediator.</p>\n<p>If the dispute remains unresolved after sixty (60) days from the commencement of mediation, or if mediation is declined by either Party, all such disputes, controversies, or claims shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Administrator, e.g., the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\")] in accordance with its [Specify Applicable Rules, e.g., Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures] then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or, failing agreement, appointed in accordance with the rules of the selected administrator. The seat of arbitration shall be [Arbitration Location], and the language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>\n<p>The Parties expressly waive their right to a jury trial and agree that arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of all disputes covered by this Section, except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief arising from the breach or threatened breach of the confidentiality, intellectual property, or non-solicitation provisions of this Agreement, which may be pursued in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedies otherwise available in law or equity, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and specific performance, but shall not have the authority to award punitive damages. Each Party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, and the costs of the arbitration (including the arbitrator's fees) shall be shared equally, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator based on the prevailing party status or the specific circumstances of the dispute.</p>\n<h2>9.

The limitations set forth in this section are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between the Employer and the Employee and reflect an agreed-upon allocation of risk.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>\n        <p>\n            12.1.

Dispute Resolution</h2>\n        <p>\n            13.1.

If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of the request for mediation, then any unresolved dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Association, e.g., American Arbitration Association (AAA)] in accordance with its then-current Employment Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall take place in [City], [State/Country], and the language of the arbitration shall be English.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>14.

Term</h2>\n<p>This offer of employment, if accepted by you, shall commence on the agreed-upon start date of <strong>[Start Date]</strong>. Your employment with [Company Name] shall be \"at-will,\" meaning that either you or [Company Name] may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without cause or notice, subject to applicable federal, state, and local laws. This \"at-will\" employment relationship cannot be modified or altered, either expressly or implicitly, except by a written agreement signed by a duly authorized officer of [Company Name]. This offer, and your continued employment, is contingent upon the successful completion of all pre-employment requirements, including but not limited to, a background check, drug screening (if applicable), and verification of your legal eligibility to work in the United States, as well as your adherence to all company policies and procedures.</p>\n<h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>\n<p>Your gross annual base salary for the position of [Job Title] will be <strong>[Salary]</strong> ([Currency]), subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings as required by law or authorized by you. This salary will be paid to you in regular installments, consistent with the Company's standard payroll schedule, which is currently on a [Payment Frequency] basis.

You shall not, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, copy, or permit the disclosure or use of any Confidential Information to any third party or for any purpose other than for the sole benefit of [Company Name] in the performance of your duties as [Job Title].

The only exceptions to this confidentiality obligation are for information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of your unauthorized disclosure, (b) was available to you on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by [Company Name], or (c) is required to be disclosed by law or court order, provided you give prompt written notice to [Company Name] prior to such disclosure to allow [Company Name] to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. You acknowledge that any breach of this confidentiality provision will cause irreparable harm to [Company Name] for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and therefore, [Company Name] shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>\n<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>\n    As a condition of employment with [Company Name], [New Hire's Name] agrees that all inventions, discoveries, designs, developments, methods, processes, compositions, works of authorship, and other intellectual property (collectively, \"Work Product\") conceived, developed, or reduced to practice by [New Hire's Name], either alone or jointly with others, during the period of employment and within the scope of employment, shall be the sole and exclusive property of [Company Name].

[New Hire's Name] further agrees to identify and list on a schedule (if applicable) any inventions or intellectual property created prior to employment that are excluded from this assignment. This Section 5 shall survive the termination of [New Hire's Name]'s employment with [Company Name] for any reason.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Termination</h2>\n<p>This offer of employment, if accepted, will establish an \"at-will\" employment relationship between you and [Company Name]. This means that either you or [Company Name] may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject to applicable law.

Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Offer Letter, and any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Offer Letter, its subject matter, or its formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [State], United States of America, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of [State]. The Parties irrevocably agree that the federal and state courts located in [County], [State], United States of America, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Offer Letter or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).

Each of Disclosing Party A and Disclosing Party B may be referred to individually as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\"</p>\n<p>WHEREAS, the Parties desire to engage in discussions concerning [Brief Description of Purpose, e.g., a potential business collaboration, joint venture, or strategic partnership] (the \"Purpose\"), which may involve the disclosure of certain confidential and proprietary information by each Party to the other Party;</p>\n<p>WHEREAS, the Parties acknowledge that such confidential information is valuable, proprietary, and sensitive, and its unauthorized disclosure could cause irreparable harm to the respective Party;</p>\n<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:</p>\n<h2>1. Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below:</p>\n<p><b>\"Confidential Information\"</b> shall mean any and all information, in any form or medium, whether written, oral, electronic, visual, or otherwise, disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\") or its Representatives, whether before or after the Effective Date, that is designated as confidential, proprietary, or secret, or that, by its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure, would reasonably be understood by the Receiving Party to be confidential. This includes, without limitation, trade secrets, business plans, financial information, customer lists, marketing strategies, product designs, software, source code, algorithms, data, know-how, inventions, technical specifications, research and development data, and any other information related to the Disclosing Party's business operations, products, or services. Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault or breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (b) was rightfully known by the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party, without obligation of confidentiality; (c) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.</p>\n<p><b>\"Disclosing Party\"</b> shall mean the Party to this Agreement that discloses or makes available Confidential Information to the other Party.</p>\n<p><b>\"Receiving Party\"</b> shall mean the Party to this Agreement that receives or obtains Confidential Information from the other Party.</p>\n<p><b>\"Effective Date\"</b> shall mean [Effective Date], the date on which this Agreement becomes binding upon both Parties.</p>\n<p><b>\"Permitted Purpose\"</b> shall mean the evaluation of a potential business relationship between [Party A] and [Party B] concerning [brief description of the purpose, e.g., \"a joint venture opportunity,\" \"a potential acquisition,\" \"the development of a new product\"].</p>\n<p><b>\"Representatives\"</b> shall mean, with respect to a Party, its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, and independent contractors who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those contained herein.</p>\n<h2>2. Term</h2>\n<p>This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"Agreement\") shall become effective on the date of its last signature by both parties (the \"Effective Date\"), which is hereby acknowledged as [Effective Date]. The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of [Number] ([e.g., Two]) years thereafter, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions herein. Following the initial term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive periods of [Number] ([e.g., One]) year each, unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal to the other Party at least [Number] ([e.g., Thirty]) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use pertaining to Confidential Information, as defined in Section 3, shall survive indefinitely with respect to trade secrets and for a period of [Number] ([e.g., Five]) years from the date of disclosure for all other Confidential Information, or until such information lawfully becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party. All other rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement that by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration shall so survive.</p>\n<h2>3. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>\n    Both [Party A] and [Party B] (each, a \"Party\" and collectively, the \"Parties\") acknowledge and agree that during the course of their business discussions concerning [Permitted Purpose], they may disclose to each other certain confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information. \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any and all non-public information, whether commercial, financial, technical, operational, strategic, or otherwise, disclosed by one Party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other Party (the \"Receiving Party\"), whether orally, in writing, visually, or by any other means, including but not limited to, trade secrets, know-how, business plans, financial data, product specifications, customer lists, marketing strategies, software, algorithms, designs, prototypes, and any information marked or identified as confidential or which, by its nature, would reasonably be understood to be confidential. The Receiving Party agrees to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and to use such information solely for the [Permitted Purpose]. The Receiving Party further agrees not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except as expressly permitted herein. The Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Access to Confidential Information shall be restricted to those employees, contractors, and agents of the Receiving Party who have a legitimate \"need-to-know\" for the [Permitted Purpose] and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained herein. The obligations of confidentiality set forth in this Section 3 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of [Term, e.g., five (5) years] from the date of disclosure of the respective Confidential Information.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>All Intellectual Property Rights, including but not limited to patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and any other proprietary rights, in and to the [Confidential Information] disclosed by the [Disclosing Party] to the [Receiving Party] under this Agreement shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the [Disclosing Party]. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to the [Receiving Party] under any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of the [Disclosing Party] or any third party, except for the limited right to use the [Confidential Information] solely for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship as outlined in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The [Receiving Party] acknowledges and agrees that the disclosure of [Confidential Information] does not constitute a sale, assignment, or transfer of any intellectual property rights of the [Disclosing Party] to the [Receiving Party]. The [Receiving Party] further agrees not to file any patent applications, copyright registrations, trademark applications, or any other intellectual property registrations based on, derived from, or incorporating the [Confidential Information] without the express prior written consent of the [Disclosing Party]. Any intellectual property developed independently by the [Receiving Party] without reference to or reliance upon the [Confidential Information] shall remain the property of the [Receiving Party].</p>\n<h2>5. Warranties</h2>\n<p>\nEach Party acknowledges that neither Party is under any obligation to disclose any Confidential Information under this Agreement, nor is either Party obligated to proceed with any business transaction or relationship with the other Party. All Confidential Information is provided \"AS IS\" and without any warranty, express or implied, regarding its accuracy, completeness, or performance. The Disclosing Party expressly disclaims all warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its representatives shall be liable to the Receiving Party or any of its representatives for any errors or omissions in the Confidential Information or for any loss or damage arising from the use of or reliance upon the Confidential Information. The disclosure of Confidential Information under this Agreement shall not be construed as granting, conferring, or implying any rights, licenses, or interests in any patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party. This Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between [Party A] and [Party B], nor does it obligate either Party to enter into any future agreement or transaction.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>Each Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or in connection with any breach by the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the unauthorized use, disclosure, or misappropriation of the Indemnified Party's Confidential Information. This indemnification obligation shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise. The Indemnified Party shall provide prompt written notice of any such claim and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of any such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have sole control over the defense and settlement of any claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim that imposes any obligation or liability on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent.</p>\n<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>\n    EXCEPT FOR BREACHES OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION [X. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS] OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER [PARTY A] NOR [PARTY B] SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, INCURRED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR DISCLOSURE OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n</p>\n<p>\n    THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO DAMAGES ARISING FROM A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR FRAUD. FURTHERMORE, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT OR EXCLUDE ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NOR SHALL IT LIMIT EITHER PARTY'S RIGHT TO SEEK EQUITABLE RELIEF, SUCH AS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, FOR ANY ACTUAL OR THREATENED BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n</p>\n<h2>8. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Agreement shall commence on the [Effective Date] and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of [Number] ([e.g., five (5)]) years from the [Effective Date], unless terminated earlier as provided herein. Either [Party A] or [Party B] may terminate this Agreement upon [Number] ([e.g., thirty (30)]) days' prior written notice to the other party; however, such termination shall not relieve either party of its obligations hereunder with respect to Confidential Information disclosed prior to the effective date of termination. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use set forth in Section 3 (Confidentiality Obligations) shall survive for a period of [Number] ([e.g., ten (10)]) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information, or indefinitely for trade secrets as defined by applicable law. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, each party shall, at the disclosing party's option, promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information of the other party, including all copies, reproductions, summaries, and analyses thereof, and certify such destruction in writing. The provisions of Sections 3 (Confidentiality Obligations), 7 (Remedies), 8 (Termination), 9 (Governing Law), and 10 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>9. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of [Governing Law State], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing Law State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [Governing Law State]. The Parties irrevocably agree that the state and federal courts located in [Specific County/District], [Governing Law State], [Governing Law Country] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to venue in such courts, including any claim of inconvenient forum. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Party hereto waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, its formation, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, shall first be subject to good-faith negotiation between the Parties for a period of thirty (30) days from the date one Party notifies the other of such dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within the specified period, either Party may then submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the [Arbitration Rules, e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association] then in effect, by [Number, e.g., one or three] arbitrator(s) mutually agreed upon by the Parties or, failing agreement, appointed in accordance with the said rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be [Arbitration Location, e.g., City, State, Country], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon the Parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party reserves the right to seek injunctive relief or any other equitable remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, as monetary damages alone may be an insufficient remedy for such breaches. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the [Governing Law State], without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>\n<h2>11.

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Non-Compete Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below:</p>\n<p><strong>\"Agreement\"</strong> shall mean this Non-Compete Agreement, including all its terms, conditions, and covenants, entered into by and between [Company Name] and [Employee Name] on [Effective Date].</p>\n<p><strong>\"Company\"</strong> shall mean [Company Name], a [State of Incorporation/Organization] corporation/entity, with its principal place of business located at [Company Address], and its successors and assigns.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Employee\"</strong> shall mean [Employee Name], an individual residing at [Employee Address], who was formerly employed by the Company.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Confidential Information\"</strong> shall mean any non-public information, whether proprietary or not, related to the Company's business, operations, products, services, customers, pricing, strategies, or trade secrets, to which the Employee had access during the course of their employment with the Company.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Competitive Business\"</strong> shall mean any person, firm, corporation, or other entity that engages in, or is planning to engage in, any business activity that directly or indirectly competes with the products, services, or operations of the Company within the Restricted Territory during the Restricted Period.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Restricted Period\"</strong> shall mean the period commencing immediately upon the termination of the Employee's employment with the Company and continuing for a duration of [Duration] thereafter.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Restricted Territory\"</strong> shall mean the geographic area encompassing [Geographic Area], including but not limited to all cities, counties, and states within this defined region where the Company conducts business or has active clients.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Clients\"</strong> or <strong>\"Customers\"</strong> shall mean any individual, entity, or organization who was a client or customer of the Company at any point during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the termination of the Employee's employment, or with whom the Company had active discussions or proposals for business during that same period.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Solicit\"</strong> shall mean any direct or indirect communication, inducement, or attempt to persuade, influence, or entice any Client or Customer to cease or reduce their business relationship with the Company, or to transfer their business to a Competitive Business.</p>\n<h2>2. Term</h2>\n<p>This Non-Compete Agreement (the \"Agreement\") shall commence on the Effective Date, which is defined as the last date of employment of [Employee Name] with [Company Name] (the \"Company\"), or [Effective Date], whichever is later. The obligations and restrictions set forth in Sections 3 (Non-Compete Covenant) and 4 (Non-Solicitation) of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a period of [duration] following the Effective Date (the \"Restricted Period\"), regardless of the reason for the termination of employment.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Restricted Period shall automatically extend for any period during which [Employee Name] is in breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, up to a maximum cumulative extension of [additional duration, e.g., one year], to ensure the Company receives the full benefit of the agreed-upon restriction period. The parties acknowledge and agree that this duration is reasonable and necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests, including its confidential information, trade secrets, and customer relationships within the [geographic area] market.</p>\n<p>It is expressly understood that the termination of [Employee Name]'s employment with the Company, for any reason whatsoever, shall not affect the enforceability or duration of the covenants contained within this Agreement, which are intended to survive such termination.

The Employee expressly acknowledges and agrees that this continued employment, and the benefits derived therefrom, are adequate and sufficient to support the enforceability of all restrictive covenants. No additional compensation, beyond the Employee's regular compensation and benefits provided during the course of employment, shall be due or payable to the Employee specifically for their adherence to the terms of this Agreement, unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon in a separate, written addendum.

Such Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, business plans, marketing strategies, financial data, customer lists, pricing policies, operational methods, technical data, product development, software, inventions, and any other non-public information that gives [Company Name] an advantage over competitors or is treated as confidential by [Company Name].</p>\n<p>The Former Employee covenants and agrees that at no time, either during or after the cessation of employment with [Company Name], will they directly or indirectly use, disclose, disseminate, or exploit for their own benefit or the benefit of any third party, any Confidential Information obtained during the course of their employment. This obligation of confidentiality shall apply regardless of whether such information is marked as \"confidential\" or not, provided it is of a nature that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential.</p>\n<p>The Former Employee further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information. Upon the termination of employment for any reason, or at any time upon the request of [Company Name], the Former Employee shall immediately return to [Company Name] all documents, records, notebooks, software, data, and all other tangible or intangible property (including all copies thereof) containing or relating to Confidential Information, regardless of whether such items were prepared by the Former Employee or others. The obligations of confidentiality set forth in this Section 4 shall survive the termination of the Former Employee's employment and the expiration or termination of this Agreement for an indefinite period, or until such information lawfully becomes public knowledge through no fault of the Former Employee.</p>\n<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>\n    [Employee Name] acknowledges and agrees that all inventions, discoveries, designs, developments, methods, modifications, improvements, processes, algorithms, data, programs, software, original works of authorship, formulas, techniques, know-how, secrets, ideas, and other intellectual property, whether or not patentable, copyrightable, or registrable under any intellectual property laws, that are conceived, made, developed, or reduced to practice by [Employee Name] alone or jointly with others during the period of employment with [Company Name] and that relate to the business, products, or services of [Company Name], or result from any work performed by [Employee Name] for [Company Name] (collectively, \"Company Intellectual Property\"), are the sole and exclusive property of [Company Name].\n</p>\n<p>\n    [Employee Name] hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to [Company Name] all right, title, and interest in and to any and all Company Intellectual Property, including all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights worldwide.

[Employee Name] further certifies that no such materials or information, or any copies thereof, will be retained by [Employee Name] or transferred to any third party.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Non-Compete Agreement shall become effective on [Effective Date] and shall remain in full force and effect throughout the duration of [Employee Name]'s employment with [Employer Name] and, specifically, for the post-employment restrictive periods as defined in Section 3 (\"Non-Compete Covenant\") and Section 4 (\"Non-Solicitation Covenant\") of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any termination of [Employee Name]'s employment with [Employer Name] for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntary, with or without cause, the covenants and obligations set forth in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this Agreement, including but not limited to the Non-Compete Covenant, Non-Solicitation Covenant, and Confidentiality obligations, shall survive such termination and remain fully enforceable for the respective periods specified therein. This Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment and does not alter the at-will nature of [Employee Name]'s employment, if applicable, nor does it guarantee employment for any definite period. The termination of this Agreement itself, prior to the expiration of all restrictive periods, shall only occur upon mutual written agreement of both [Employer Name] and [Employee Name], or as otherwise mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>7. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Non-Compete Agreement, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing State], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [Governing State]. The parties hereto irrevocably agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [Governing County] County, [Governing State], and each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding.

Both parties agree to meet and confer promptly to attempt to resolve the dispute amicably.</p>\n<p>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through direct negotiations within thirty (30) days of the initial notification of the dispute, either party may, by written notice to the other, request mediation. The mediation shall be conducted by a mutually agreed-upon mediator in [Geographic Area] or, if no agreement can be reached on a mediator, by a mediator appointed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or a similar reputable dispute resolution service. The costs of mediation shall be borne equally by both parties.</p>\n<p>Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of the request for mediation, the dispute shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or, failing agreement, appointed by the AAA. The arbitration shall take place in [Geographic Area], [State]. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding upon both parties, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8 shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm, including but not limited to the breach or threatened breach of confidentiality or non-compete obligations, pending the outcome of any negotiation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in [County, State] for any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration or for the enforcement of any arbitration award.</p>\n<h2>9.

Definitions</h2>\n        <p>\n            <strong>1.1. \"Confidential Information\"</strong> means any and all non-public information, whether tangible or intangible, disclosed by Company to Employee or otherwise obtained by Employee during the course of employment, including but not limited to, trade secrets, business plans, financial data, marketing strategies, customer lists, pricing information, product development, software, technical data, designs, formulas, processes, and any other information that provides the Company with a competitive advantage. This definition explicitly excludes information that is generally known to the public through no fault of the Employee or that is independently developed by Employee without reference to Company's Confidential Information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>1.2. \"Competitive Business\"</strong> means any person, entity, or organization that engages in, or plans to engage in, the same or substantially similar business activities as the Company, or offers products or services that are competitive with those offered by the Company, within the Restricted Territory. This includes, but is not limited to, direct competitors, indirect competitors, and any business that could reasonably be perceived as competing with the Company's current or reasonably foreseeable future business operations. The determination of whether a business is \"competitive\" shall be made by the Company in good faith, considering the scope of its operations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>1.3. \"Restricted Period\"</strong> means the period commencing on the Effective Date and continuing for a duration of [Duration] thereafter. This period is carefully considered by the parties to be reasonable and necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests, allowing the Company sufficient time to mitigate any potential competitive harm resulting from the Employee's departure and access to proprietary information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>1.4. \"Restricted Territory\"</strong> means the geographic area encompassing [Geographic Area]. This territory is defined based on the Company's primary operational areas, market reach, and where the Employee had significant client interaction, business development responsibilities, or access to market-specific confidential information during their employment. The parties acknowledge that this geographic scope is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company's goodwill and competitive standing.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>1.5. \"Clients\"</strong> means any individuals, companies, or entities with whom the Company had an active business relationship, or was actively soliciting, at any point during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Effective Date, and with whom Employee had direct or indirect contact, or about whom Employee obtained Confidential Information during their employment. This includes current customers, prospective customers, and any other parties with whom the Company maintained a commercial engagement or was engaged in substantive discussions for future business.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <strong>1.6. \"Solicit\"</strong> means to directly or indirectly initiate contact with, entice, persuade, or attempt to persuade, any Client or employee of the Company to cease doing business with the Company or to engage in business with a Competitive Business, or to leave their employment with the Company. This includes, but is not limited to, direct communication, indirect communication through third parties, or any action that could reasonably be construed as an attempt to divert business or talent away from the Company.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>2. Non-Competition</h2>\n        <p>\n            During the Restricted Period, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, for themselves or on behalf of any other person or entity, engage in, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by, participate in, or be connected in any manner with, any Competitive Business within the Restricted Territory. This prohibition extends to serving as an officer, director, employee, consultant, independent contractor, advisor, shareholder (except for passive ownership of less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a publicly traded company), partner, or in any other capacity that involves responsibilities or duties similar to those performed for the Company or that would involve the use or disclosure of Company's Confidential Information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The parties acknowledge that this non-competition covenant is essential for protecting the Company's proprietary information, trade secrets, and significant investments in developing its client base and market position. Employee further agrees that the scope, duration, and geographic limitations of this covenant are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests and do not impose an undue hardship on the Employee, given the Employee's skills and the availability of alternative employment opportunities outside the scope of this restriction.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>3. Non-Solicitation of Clients</h2>\n        <p>\n            During the Restricted Period, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, for themselves or on behalf of any other person or entity, Solicit or attempt to Solicit any Clients of the Company for the purpose of providing products or services that are competitive with those offered by the Company. This restriction applies regardless of whether the Client was introduced to the Employee by the Company or was known to the Employee prior to their employment, provided that the Employee had contact with, or obtained Confidential Information about, such Client during their employment with the Company.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This non-solicitation covenant is critical to preserving the Company's established customer relationships and goodwill, which were developed through substantial effort and investment by the Company and to which the Employee had significant exposure. The Employee acknowledges that any attempt to divert these Clients would cause irreparable harm to the Company, as these relationships represent a core asset of the business.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>4. Non-Solicitation of Employees</h2>\n        <p>\n            During the Restricted Period, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, for themselves or on behalf of any other person or entity, Solicit, induce, or encourage any employee of the Company to leave their employment with the Company or to accept employment with any Competitive Business. This prohibition extends to any individual who was an employee of the Company at any time during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Effective Date.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Company has invested significant resources in recruiting, training, and retaining its employees, and the loss of such employees to a competitor would cause substantial disruption and economic damage. Employee acknowledges that their knowledge of Company personnel, their skills, and their compensation structures, gained during employment, could be unfairly leveraged to the Company's detriment, and this covenant is necessary to prevent such unfair competition.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>\n        <p>\n            Employee acknowledges and reaffirms their continuing obligations under any separate confidentiality agreement or policy with the Company. Employee agrees that at no time, either during or after the Restricted Period, shall they use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Company, except as required by law or with the express written consent of the Company. This obligation of confidentiality is perpetual and survives the termination of this Agreement and Employee's employment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Employee further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to protect the secrecy of and prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information. Employee understands that the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to the Company, for which monetary damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>\n        <p>\n            Employee acknowledges that all inventions, discoveries, improvements, works of authorship, and other intellectual property created, conceived, or reduced to practice by Employee, alone or with others, during the course of employment with the Company and related to the Company's business, are the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Employee agrees to promptly disclose all such intellectual property to the Company and to execute any documents necessary to assign such intellectual property rights to the Company.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This provision ensures that the Company retains full ownership of all intellectual property developed as a result of the Employee's work for the Company, reinforcing the Company's competitive position and protecting its innovations. Employee agrees to cooperate fully with the Company in securing and enforcing its intellectual property rights, both during and after the term of their employment.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. Representations and Warranties</h2>\n        <p>\n            Employee represents and warrants that they have carefully read and fully understand the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the scope and duration of the restrictive covenants. Employee further represents that they have had the opportunity to consult with independent legal counsel of their choosing regarding this Agreement and are entering into it voluntarily, without duress or undue influence.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Employee warrants that their compliance with this Agreement will not conflict with, or result in a breach of, any other agreement or obligation to which Employee is a party, including any prior non-compete or confidentiality agreements. Employee confirms that they possess the necessary skills and qualifications to obtain suitable employment that does not violate the terms of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8. Consideration</h2>\n        <p>\n            In consideration for the covenants and agreements contained herein, Company provides Employee with valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by Employee. This consideration includes, but is not limited to, continued access to confidential and proprietary information during employment, specialized training, and the overall benefits derived from employment with the Company.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Employee acknowledges that this consideration is adequate and sufficient to support the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement, making them fair and enforceable. Employee further agrees that this consideration is separate and distinct from any compensation or benefits received as part of their regular employment, and that the enforceability of this Agreement is not contingent upon the continuation of employment for any specific period.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>9. Severability</h2>\n        <p>\n            If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. The parties intend that if any restrictive covenant is deemed unenforceable, it shall be modified by the court to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unreasonable or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court shall have the authority to modify such restriction to make it reasonable and enforceable, rather than invalidating the entire provision. This clause reflects the parties' intent to enforce the restrictive covenants to the fullest extent legally permissible.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>10. Injunctive Relief</h2>\n        <p>\n            Employee acknowledges that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, particularly those related to non-competition, non-solicitation, and confidentiality, would cause irreparable harm to the Company for which monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, Employee agrees that in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions, without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This provision is not intended to limit the Company's right to pursue any other legal or equitable remedies for a breach of this Agreement, including the recovery of damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. Employee expressly waives any claim or defense that the Company has an adequate remedy at law or that the Company must prove actual damages before being entitled to injunctive relief.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State of Governing Law], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties expressly agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in [County/City for Jurisdiction], [State of Governing Law].\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            By executing this Agreement, Employee irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to the laying of venue in such courts, including any objection based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. This choice of law and forum is intended to ensure consistent interpretation and enforcement of the Agreement and to minimize the costs and complexities associated with potential litigation.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n        <p>\n            Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall be resolved exclusively through litigation in the courts specified in Section 11. The parties expressly waive any right to a jury trial in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Prior to initiating any litigation, the parties agree to engage in good faith negotiations to attempt to resolve the dispute amicably. However, nothing in this clause shall prevent the Company from seeking immediate injunctive relief in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the restrictive covenants, as outlined in Section 10, without first engaging in negotiations.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. No oral modifications, amendments, or waivers shall be effective.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The parties acknowledge that they have not relied upon any representations or statements made by the other party that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. This clause ensures that the terms and conditions contained within this document are the sole and binding agreement between the parties concerning the non-compete obligations.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>14. Amendments</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement may not be amended, modified, or waived except by a written instrument executed by both the Company and the Employee. Any attempt to amend, modify, or waive any provision of this Agreement orally or by conduct shall be null and void and of no effect.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This requirement for written amendments ensures clarity, prevents misunderstandings, and protects both parties from claims of unwritten changes to the terms of this legally binding document. The parties agree that no course of conduct or delay in enforcing any provision shall constitute a waiver of such provision.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>15. Assignment</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement is personal to the Employee and may not be assigned by the Employee without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company may assign this Agreement to any successor in interest or affiliate without the consent of the Employee.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This clause ensures that the Company's rights under this Agreement can be transferred in the event of a merger, acquisition, or other corporate restructuring, while preventing the Employee from unilaterally transferring their obligations to another party, thereby preserving the intended protections for the Company's business interests.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>16. Waiver</h2>\n        <p>\n            No waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other provision. No waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            A failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. This ensures that the Company retains its rights even if it chooses not to immediately enforce a particular breach.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>17. Counterparts</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile or electronic signatures shall be deemed original signatures for all purposes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Non-Compete Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above.</p>\n\n        <table style=\"width: 100%; border: none;\">\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding: 20pt 0 0 0;\">\n                    <div class=\"signature-line\"></div>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\"><strong>[Company Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\">By: ______________________________</p>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\">Name: [Authorized Signatory Name]</p>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\">Title: [Authorized Signatory Title]</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding: 20pt 0 0 0;\">\n                    <div class=\"signature-line\"></div>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\"><strong>[Employee Name]</strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\">By: ______________________________</p>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\">Name: [Employee Name]</p>\n                    <p style=\"text-align: left; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0;\">Date: ____________________________</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

The Employee further agrees that all such IP shall be the sole and exclusive property of [Company Name] and hereby assigns, and agrees to assign, all rights, title, and interest in and to such IP to [Company Name]. The Employee also acknowledges their ongoing obligation to protect [Company Name]'s confidential and proprietary information, including IP, both during and after the term of employment, and to return all company property and IP upon cessation of employment, as more fully described in the Handbook.</p>\n<h2>5. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Employee Handbook Acknowledgement Form and the Employee Handbook itself do not constitute an employment contract, nor do they alter the \"at-will\" nature of employment with [Company Name]. Employment with [Company Name] is for an indefinite period and may be terminated by either the employee or [Company Name] at any time, with or without cause or notice, and for any reason not prohibited by applicable law. Nothing contained in this Acknowledgement Form or in the Employee Handbook shall be construed as creating a contract of employment, express or implied, or a promise of continued employment for any definite term. No manager, supervisor, or representative of [Company Name], other than a duly authorized officer of [Company Name] in a formal written agreement signed by both the officer and the employee, has the authority to enter into any agreement for employment for a specified period or to make any agreement contrary to the foregoing \"at-will\" employment relationship.

This document is a critical component of your employment with [Company Name], outlining the expectations, rights, and responsibilities of all employees, and it is imperative that you fully comprehend its contents.</p>\n\n        <p>Your signature below signifies your commitment to adhering to all established company policies, which are designed to foster a productive, respectful, and legally compliant work environment.

Acknowledgement of Receipt</h2>\n\n        <p>I hereby confirm that I have received a copy of the [Company Name] Employee Handbook, effective [Insert Date of Handbook Version], either in physical print or via electronic access. I understand that this handbook contains important information regarding the Company's policies, procedures, rules, and benefits, and that it is my responsibility to familiarize myself with its entire contents.</p>\n\n        <p>I acknowledge that this current version of the Employee Handbook supersedes all prior oral or written statements, policies, or understandings regarding the Company's employment practices. I have been informed of where to access the handbook (e.g., HR office, company intranet, shared drive) and understand that it is my ongoing responsibility to ensure I am referencing the most current version available.</p>\n\n        <h2>2. Acknowledgement of Understanding and Compliance</h2>\n\n        <p>I affirm that I have read, understood, and agree to comply with all policies, procedures, and rules contained within the [Company Name] Employee Handbook, as well as any future revisions or additions that may be implemented.

I understand that my failure to read or understand any policy does not excuse me from compliance, and that the Company retains the right to enforce all policies consistently and fairly across its workforce.</p>\n\n        <h2>3. At-Will Employment Disclaimer</h2>\n\n        <p>I understand and acknowledge that my employment with [Company Name] is \"at-will,\" meaning that either I or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject only to applicable law. This \"at-will\" status cannot be modified by any oral statements or implied agreements.</p>\n\n        <p>I further understand that no statement, policy, or practice contained within this Employee Handbook, or any other Company document, creates an express or implied contract of employment for a definite term. Only the President or an authorized officer of [Company Name] has the authority to enter into an employment agreement for a specified period, and any such agreement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the authorized officer.</p>\n\n        <h2>4. Obligation to Read and Ask Questions</h2>\n\n        <p>I acknowledge that it is my personal responsibility to carefully read and understand the entire Employee Handbook.

Updates and Revisions</h2>\n\n        <p>I understand that the Company reserves the right to revise, modify, delete, or add to any policies, procedures, rules, or benefits described in this Handbook at any time, with or without notice, except as may be required by law. I acknowledge that all such revisions or additions will become effective immediately upon their issuance and will be binding upon me.</p>\n\n        <p>I agree that it is my continuing responsibility to review and understand any new or modified policies that are communicated by the Company. I understand that official communications regarding handbook updates will typically be distributed via [e.g., email, company intranet, team meetings], and I commit to staying informed of such changes.</p>\n\n        <h2>6. Confidentiality of Information</h2>\n\n        <p>I understand that during my employment, I may have access to confidential and proprietary information belonging to [Company Name], including but not limited to trade secrets, customer lists, financial data, strategic plans, product development information, and employee records. I agree to maintain the strict confidentiality of all such information both during and after my employment, and to use it solely for the benefit of the Company.</p>\n\n        <p>I acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential information can cause significant harm to the Company and may result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, as well as potential legal liability. I commit to safeguarding all confidential information and adhering to all Company policies regarding data security and information handling.</p>\n\n        <h2>7. No Contract of Employment</h2>\n\n        <p>I understand that this Employee Handbook is not a contract of employment, express or implied, and does not guarantee employment for any definite period. It is a statement of current policies and procedures and is not intended to create any contractual rights or obligations between the Company and its employees.</p>\n\n        <p>I reiterate my understanding that my employment is at-will, and that nothing in this handbook should be construed as altering that at-will relationship.

Term</h2>\n<p>This Master Services Agreement (\"Agreement\") shall commence on the [Effective Date] (\"Effective Date\") and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial term of [Initial Term Duration, e.g., three (3) years] from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\").</p>\n<p>Following the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive renewal terms of [Renewal Term Duration, e.g., one (1) year] each (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either Party provides written notice of its intent not to renew to the other Party at least [Notice Period, e.g., ninety (90) days] prior to the end of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Such notice of non-renewal must be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section [X. Notices] of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>For clarity, the Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Terms shall collectively be referred to as the \"Term\" of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement relating to termination for cause or convenience, as set forth in Section [X. Termination] herein, shall remain applicable throughout the Term, notwithstanding any automatic renewal provisions.</p>\n<h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>\n<p>4.1. <strong>Fees and Invoicing.</strong> For all Professional Services rendered under this Master Services Agreement and any Statement of Work (\"SOW\") executed hereunder, [Client] shall pay [Consulting Firm] the fees as specified in the applicable SOW (\"Service Fees\"). Unless otherwise explicitly stated in an SOW, [Consulting Firm] shall invoice [Client] on a monthly basis in arrears for all services performed and approved expenses incurred during the preceding month. Each invoice shall provide a detailed breakdown of services rendered, hours expended (if applicable), and reimbursable expenses, accompanied by supporting documentation where required.</p>\n<p>4.2. <strong>Payment Due Date.</strong> All undisputed invoices are due and payable by [Client] within [Number] ([e.g., thirty (30)]) calendar days from the date of the invoice. Payments shall be made in [Currency, e.g., United States Dollars (USD)] via electronic funds transfer to an account designated by [Consulting Firm], or by such other method as mutually agreed upon in writing. Time is of the essence for all payments due under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>4.3. <strong>Late Payments.</strong> In the event that [Client] fails to pay any undisputed invoice by the due date, [Consulting Firm] reserves the right to charge interest on the overdue amount at the rate of [Interest Rate, e.g., one and one-half percent (1.5%)] per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, calculated from the due date until the date of full payment. Such interest shall accrue daily and be compounded monthly. [Client] shall also be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by [Consulting Firm] in collecting any overdue amounts, including but not limited to attorney's fees, court costs, and collection agency fees.</p>\n<p>4.4. <strong>Invoice Disputes.</strong> If [Client] disputes any portion of an invoice, [Client] must notify [Consulting Firm] in writing within [Number] ([e.g., ten (10)]) calendar days of the invoice date, providing specific details of the disputed amount and the reasons for the dispute. [Client] shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice by the due date. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disputed amounts promptly and in good faith. Failure to dispute an invoice within the specified timeframe shall constitute acceptance of the invoice as accurate and payable in full.</p>\n<p>4.5. <strong>Taxes.</strong> All Service Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, duties, levies, or similar governmental assessments, including but not limited to sales, use, value-added, or withholding taxes (collectively, \"Taxes\"). [Client] shall be responsible for paying all such Taxes arising from or related to the services provided under this Agreement, excluding taxes based solely on [Consulting Firm]'s net income. If [Consulting Firm] is required by law to collect any Taxes from [Client], [Consulting Firm] will itemize such Taxes on the invoice, and [Client] agrees to pay them unless [Client] provides [Consulting Firm] with a valid tax exemption certificate acceptable to the relevant taxing authority.</p>\n<p>4.6. <strong>Suspension of Services.</strong> Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to [Consulting Firm] at law or in equity, [Consulting Firm] may, upon [Number] ([e.g., five (5)]) business days' prior written notice to [Client], suspend the performance of any and all Professional Services under this Agreement and any active SOWs if [Client] fails to pay any undisputed invoice within [Number] ([e.g., ten (10)]) calendar days after the due date. Services will resume only upon full payment of all outstanding undisputed amounts, including any accrued interest and collection costs. Such suspension shall not relieve [Client] of its payment obligations or extend the term of any SOW.</p>\n<h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>Both [Consulting Firm Name] (hereinafter \"Service Provider\") and [Client Company Name] (hereinafter \"Client\"), and their respective employees, agents, and subcontractors, acknowledge that during the course of providing or receiving services under this Master Services Agreement (hereinafter \"Agreement\"), they may have access to or become privy to confidential and proprietary information belonging to the other party. \"Confidential Information\" shall include, but not be limited to, trade secrets, business plans, financial data, customer lists, technical information, software, designs, processes, marketing strategies, and any other information designated as confidential or which, by its nature, would reasonably be understood to be confidential.</p>\n<p>Each party agrees to hold the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence and to use such information solely for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. Neither party shall disclose, disseminate, or make available any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, except as expressly permitted herein or required by law. The receiving party shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information, exercising at least the same degree of care as it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>\n<p>The obligations of confidentiality set forth herein shall not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was rightfully in the possession of the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party, as evidenced by written records; (c) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information; (d) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (e) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided that the receiving party provides prompt written notice to the disclosing party to allow it to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon the disclosing party's request, the receiving party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information, including all copies thereof, in its possession or control, and certify in writing its compliance with this provision, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The confidentiality obligations hereunder shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of [Number] years, or indefinitely for trade secrets.</p>\n<p>Each party acknowledges that any breach of this Confidentiality section would cause irreparable harm to the other party for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>\n<h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise expressly agreed in a Statement of Work, all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and trademarks, in and to all materials, deliverables, work product, and documentation (collectively, \"Work Product\") developed or created by [Consulting Firm] or its personnel in the course of performing the Services under this Agreement and any associated Statement of Work shall be the sole and exclusive property of [Consulting Firm].</p>\n\n<p>Upon full and final payment of all fees due for the Services, [Consulting Firm] hereby grants to [Client] a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, and display the Work Product for [Client]'s internal business purposes only.

Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Master Services Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing Law State], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing Law State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [Governing Law State]. The parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [Governing Jurisdiction], and each party irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to the laying of venue in such courts.

SCOPE OF SERVICES</h2>\n        <p>\n            Consultant shall provide Services to Client as described in individual SOWs executed by both Parties from time to time.

CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Receiving Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party shall not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the applicable SOW, nor shall it disclose such information to any third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of [Number] ([e.g., five (5)]) years, or indefinitely for trade secrets.

Consultant hereby assigns, and agrees to assign, all right, title, and interest in and to such Deliverables to Client.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant retains all Intellectual Property Rights in its pre-existing materials, methodologies, tools, software, and general know-how (\"Consultant Background IP\") used in performing the Services.

Service Credits are non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash.</p>\n\n<p>4.4. **Claim Process.** To claim Service Credits, [Customer] must submit a written request to [SaaS Provider] within [Service Credit Claim Period] days following the end of the calendar month in which the SLA breach occurred. The request must include sufficient detail to validate the breach, including, but not limited to, the dates and times of the incident(s), affected services, and a description of the impact. Failure to submit a timely and adequately detailed claim will result in forfeiture of the right to receive Service Credits for that incident.</p>\n\n<p>4.5. **Issuance and Application of Service Credits.** Upon validation of a legitimate SLA breach claim by [SaaS Provider], the applicable Service Credits will be applied to [Customer]'s subsequent invoice(s) for the Service, typically within [Service Credit Issuance Period] days of validation.

For the avoidance of doubt, a material breach by [Party A] shall include, but not be limited to, persistent and repeated failures to meet the Uptime Guarantee as defined in Section 3, or consistent non-compliance with the Support Response Times as defined in Section 4, where such failures are not adequately remedied through the application of Service Credits or other agreed-upon remedies, thereby fundamentally undermining the purpose of this SLA.</p>\n<p><strong>11.2 Termination by [Party B] for Persistent Non-Compliance:</strong> Notwithstanding Section 11.1, [Party B] may terminate this SLA and the underlying Master Service Agreement by providing [Number of Days] days' written notice to [Party A] if [Party A] fails to meet the Uptime Guarantee for [Number] consecutive months, or if the aggregate Service Credits issued to [Party B] exceed [Percentage]% of the monthly recurring service fees for [Number] consecutive months, indicating a systemic failure to provide the services at the agreed-upon quality levels which significantly impacts [Party B]'s operations.</p>\n<p><strong>11.3 Termination for Insolvency:</strong> Either party may terminate this SLA immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed over any of its assets, or if any similar event occurs which materially impairs the other party's ability to perform its obligations hereunder.</p>\n<p><strong>11.4 Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination of this SLA for any reason, all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall cease, except for those provisions which by their nature are intended to survive termination (e.g., confidentiality, limitation of liability, and payment obligations accrued prior to termination). [Party A] shall have no further obligation to provide the services or support under this SLA, and [Party B] shall pay all outstanding fees and charges accrued up to the effective date of termination. Termination of this SLA shall not relieve either party of any obligations incurred prior to the effective date of termination.</p>\n<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Service Level Agreement, and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to its interpretation, validity, performance, and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the [Governing Jurisdiction], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the [Governing Jurisdiction] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the [Governing Jurisdiction]. The Parties irrevocably agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [Governing Jurisdiction], and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding.

Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>\n    Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Service Level Agreement (SLA), including its formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity, shall first be subject to good faith negotiations between [Party A] and [Party B]. The parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve any such dispute amicably.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days of one party providing written notice of the dispute to the other, either party may escalate the matter to senior management representatives of both [Party A] and [Party B] for further discussion and resolution.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Should the dispute remain unresolved after an additional thirty (30) days following escalation, or such other period as the parties may mutually agree in writing, the parties irrevocably agree that any such dispute shall be finally settled by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by [Arbitration Institution Name], in accordance with its [Arbitration Rules] then in effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the said rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be [Arbitration Location], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, and the costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator based on the circumstances of the dispute.

Service Credits will be applied against future invoices for the Service and are non-refundable and non-transferable. Service Credits will not be issued if the Downtime was due to factors outside the Service Provider's control, Customer's breach of the Agreement, or Customer's failure to utilize the Service in accordance with the documentation.</p>\n\n        <h2>6. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\n        <p>Each party acknowledges that in the performance of this Agreement, it may have access to or be exposed to confidential and proprietary information belonging to the other party (\"Confidential Information\").

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>\n        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE.

Term</h2>\n<p>This Agreement shall commence on the [Effective Date] (the \"Effective Date\") and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of [Initial Term, e.g., one (1) year] from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). Following the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive additional periods of [Renewal Term, e.g., one (1) year] each (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either Party provides written notice of its intent not to renew to the other Party at least [Number, e.g., sixty (60)] days prior to the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated earlier by either Party in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 (Termination) of this Agreement.

Product/Material Supply, Delivery, and Acceptance</h2>\n<p>\n    3.1. **Supply Obligation:** [Vendor Name] hereby agrees to supply and deliver to [Buyer Name] the [Product/Material] as specified in detail within Appendix A (Product Specifications) and in strict accordance with the quantities, quality standards, and other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. All [Product/Material] supplied shall be new, of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose intended, and free from defects in material and workmanship.\n</p>\n<p>\n    3.2. **Delivery Schedules and Location:** Deliveries of the [Product/Material] shall be made strictly in accordance with the delivery schedules outlined in Appendix B (Delivery Schedule) or as otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by both Parties. Time is of the essence for all deliveries under this Agreement. All deliveries shall be made to [Delivery Location] or such other location as [Buyer Name] may designate in writing, utilizing appropriate packaging and shipping methods to prevent damage or deterioration during transit. [Vendor Name] shall bear all costs associated with packaging, shipping, and insurance until acceptance by [Buyer Name].\n</p>\n<p>\n    3.3. **Risk of Loss:** Risk of loss or damage to the [Product/Material] shall transfer from [Vendor Name] to [Buyer Name] only upon successful delivery, inspection, and formal acceptance by [Buyer Name] at the designated delivery location. Prior to acceptance, [Vendor Name] shall bear all risk of loss or damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n    3.4. **Inspection and Acceptance:** [Buyer Name] shall have a period of [Acceptance Period] business days from the date of delivery to inspect the [Product/Material] for conformity with the specifications, quality standards, quantities, and other requirements set forth in this Agreement. [Buyer Name] may, at its sole discretion, reject any [Product/Material] that does not conform to the agreed-upon standards, is damaged, or is otherwise non-compliant with the terms of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n    3.5. **Non-Conforming Goods:** In the event of rejection, [Buyer Name] shall notify [Vendor Name] in writing, specifying the nature of the non-conformity.

[Vendor Name] shall be responsible for the cost of retrieving and disposing of any rejected [Product/Material] and any associated shipping costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    3.6. **Documentation:** [Vendor Name] shall provide all necessary shipping documentation, including but not limited to, packing slips, bills of lading, certificates of origin, and certificates of analysis (if applicable), with each delivery. Failure to provide complete and accurate documentation may result in delayed acceptance or rejection of the delivery.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Quality Standards and Inspection</h2>\n<p>\n    4.1. The Vendor warrants that all [Product/Material] supplied under this Agreement shall strictly conform to the specifications, drawings, samples, and other descriptions set forth in the attached Exhibit B, \"Product Specifications Document\" (hereinafter, the \"[Specifications Document]\"), and shall be free from defects in material, workmanship, and design, and fit for the purpose intended by [Party A]. The Vendor further warrants that all [Product/Material] shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards in effect at the time of delivery, including but not limited to those pertaining to safety, environmental protection, and quality management systems.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.2. [Party A] or its designated agents shall have the right to inspect and test the [Product/Material] at any reasonable time and location, including at the Vendor's premises during manufacturing, and upon delivery at [Party A]'s designated receiving location. Such inspection shall not relieve the Vendor of its responsibility for supplying conforming [Product/Material] and shall not be deemed acceptance of the [Product/Material] if defects are subsequently discovered.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.3. Upon delivery, [Party A] shall have a period of [Inspection Period] business days from the date of receipt to inspect the [Product/Material] for conformance with the [Specifications Document] and to notify the Vendor in writing of any defects, non-conformities, or discrepancies. Failure to provide such notice within the specified [Inspection Period] shall constitute acceptance of the [Product/Material], except for latent defects not reasonably discoverable during the initial inspection, which may be notified within a reasonable time after discovery, but in no event later than [Latent Defect Notification Period] days after delivery.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4.4. In the event of any non-conforming [Product/Material], [Party A] may, at its sole discretion, reject the entire shipment, require the Vendor to repair or replace the non-conforming [Product/Material] at the Vendor's sole expense, or accept the non-conforming [Product/Material] with an equitable price reduction. The Vendor shall, within [Remedy Period] business days of receiving notice of non-conformity, remedy such non-conformity to [Party A]'s satisfaction. All costs associated with the return, repair, replacement, and re-delivery of non-conforming [Product/Material], including transportation, handling fees, and any costs incurred by [Party A] due to such non-conformity, shall be borne solely by the Vendor.\n</p>\n<h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>\n<p>\n    <strong>5.1 Invoicing:</strong> [Party B] (the \"Vendor\") shall submit detailed invoices to [Party A] (the \"Purchaser\") for all [product/material] supplied in accordance with the delivery schedules outlined in Section 3 of this Agreement. Invoices shall be submitted [e.g., monthly, upon delivery, bi-weekly] and shall include, at a minimum, the quantity of [product/material] supplied, the agreed-upon unit price, the total amount due, the invoice number, and the date of supply. All invoices must be accurate and comply with all applicable legal and tax requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>5.2 Payment Due Date:</strong> All undisputed invoices submitted by [Party B] shall be due and payable by [Party A] within [number of days, e.g., thirty (30)] calendar days from the date of [Party A]'s receipt of a valid and accurate invoice. Payments shall be made in [currency, e.g., United States Dollars (USD)] unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by both Parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>5.3 Payment Method:</strong> Payments shall be made via [e.g., electronic funds transfer (EFT) or wire transfer] to the bank account designated by [Party B] in writing, details of which shall be provided by [Party B] to [Party A] prior to the first payment. [Party B] shall be solely responsible for any bank charges, fees, or foreign exchange costs associated with receiving payments.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>5.4 Late Payments:</strong> In the event that [Party A] fails to make payment on any undisputed invoice by the due date, [Party A] shall pay interest on the overdue amount at a rate of [e.g., one percent (1%)] per month, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower, calculated from the due date until the date of full payment. Such interest shall not prejudice [Party B]'s other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, including the right to suspend further deliveries.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>5.5 Invoice Disputes:</strong> If [Party A] disputes any portion of an invoice, [Party A] shall notify [Party B] in writing within [e.g., five (5)] business days of receipt of the invoice, clearly stating the disputed amount and the specific reasons for the dispute, along with any supporting documentation. [Party A] shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice in accordance with the payment terms herein. The Parties shall promptly engage in good faith discussions to resolve any disputed amounts within [e.g., ten (10)] business days of the dispute notification.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>5.6 Taxes:</strong> Unless otherwise specified, all prices quoted by [Party B] are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, value-added, goods and services, or similar taxes, duties, or levies. [Party A] shall be responsible for all such taxes, duties, and levies imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the purchase of the [product/material], provided that [Party B] provides a valid tax invoice where required by law. If [Party A] is exempt from any such taxes, [Party A] shall provide [Party B] with a valid tax exemption certificate.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Warranties</h2>\n<p>\n    [Vendor] hereby warrants and represents to [Buyer] that, for a period of [e.g., twelve (12) months] from the date of delivery, all [Product/Material] supplied under this Agreement shall: (a) be free from defects in material, workmanship, and design; (b) conform strictly to all specifications, drawings, samples, and other requirements agreed upon by the parties; (c) be fit for the purposes for which they are intended and for which [Buyer] has informed [Vendor] they will be used; (d) be manufactured, packaged, labeled, and delivered in strict compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and industry standards, including but not limited to environmental, health, and safety regulations; (e) be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and security interests, and [Vendor] shall have good and marketable title thereto; and (f) not infringe upon any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any third party.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the event of any breach of the foregoing warranties, [Vendor] shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly repair or replace the non-conforming [Product/Material] or, at [Buyer]'s option, refund the purchase price paid for such non-conforming [Product/Material]. All warranties shall survive inspection, acceptance, and payment by [Buyer], and the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies available to [Buyer] at law or in equity.\n</p>\n<h2>7. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>\n    [Vendor] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless [Purchaser] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Indemnified Party\") and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and settlement amounts (collectively, \"Losses\"), arising out of or in connection with:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Any breach by the Indemnifying Party of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation set forth in this Agreement;</li>\n    <li>Any actual or alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets) of any third party by the [Specific Product/Material] supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnifying Party's manufacturing, packaging, or delivery processes;</li>\n    <li>Any negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party or its employees, agents, or subcontractors in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement;</li>\n    <li>Any non-compliance by the Indemnifying Party with applicable laws, regulations, or industry standards related to the manufacture, labeling, packaging, handling, or delivery of the [Specific Product/Material]; or</li>\n    <li>Any product liability claim, personal injury, death, or property damage arising directly or indirectly from the [Specific Product/Material] supplied by the Indemnifying Party, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    The Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought; however, failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend the claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to defend, negotiate, and settle any such claim, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in connection with the defense of any such claim. This indemnification obligation shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>Neither [Party A] nor [Party B] shall be liable to the other party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for lost profits, lost revenue, lost data, loss of goodwill, or business interruption, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the supply of the [product/material], even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This exclusion applies regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, and even if any limited remedy provided herein fails of its essential purpose.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the total aggregate liability of either [Party A] or [Party B] to the other for any and all claims, damages, or losses arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall in no event exceed the total amount paid or payable by [Party A] to [Party B] under this Agreement for the [product/material] during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. This limitation shall not apply to liabilities arising from a party's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability set forth in this Section 8 are a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between the parties and reflect an allocation of risk between the parties, and that [Party A] would not enter into this Agreement without such limitations. These limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<h2>9. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Agreement may be terminated under the following conditions:</p>\n<p><strong>9.1 Termination for Material Breach:</strong> Either [Party A] or [Party B] may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party commits a material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within [Number] days after receiving written notice thereof. A material breach shall include, but not be limited to, persistent failure to meet agreed-upon delivery schedules, consistent failure to adhere to specified quality standards for the [product/material], non-payment of undisputed invoices beyond the stipulated payment terms, or any other significant non-compliance with the terms herein that substantially defeats the purpose of this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>9.2 Termination for Insolvency:</strong> Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if the other party becomes insolvent, files a petition for bankruptcy, has a receiver appointed over its assets, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or ceases to conduct business in the ordinary course.</p>\n<p><strong>9.3 Termination for Convenience:</strong> [Party A] may terminate this Agreement for convenience, without cause, by providing [Party B] with at least [Number] days' prior written notice. In the event of such termination, [Party A] shall pay [Party B] for all [product/material] delivered and services rendered up to the effective date of termination, and any reasonable, documented, non-cancelable costs incurred by [Party B] specifically in anticipation of fulfilling orders placed by [Party A] prior to the notice of termination, provided [Party B] takes all reasonable steps to mitigate such costs and provides supporting documentation within [Number] days of the termination notice.</p>\n<p><strong>9.4 Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon the effective date of termination, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall cease, except for those obligations that expressly survive termination, including but not limited to, confidentiality obligations (Section [X]), indemnification (Section [Y]), and payment obligations for [product/material] delivered or services rendered prior to the termination date. [Party B] shall immediately cease all production and delivery of [product/material] and return all Confidential Information and property of [Party A] in its possession or control within [Number] days of the termination effective date.</p>\n<p><strong>9.5 Accrued Rights:</strong> Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or obligations of the parties that have accrued prior to the effective date of termination.</p>\n<h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Governing Law State], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of [Governing Law State] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation, provided however, that the parties shall first attempt to resolve any such dispute through good faith negotiation.</p>\n<p>Should negotiation fail, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation administered by [Mediation Service Provider, e.g., American Arbitration Association (AAA)] under its Commercial Mediation Procedures, before resorting to arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved through mediation within [Number] days of the commencement of mediation, or if one party declines to participate in mediation, then the dispute shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Service Provider, e.g., AAA] in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in [Arbitration Location], [Governing Law State], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon both parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<h2>Signatures</h2>\n<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Vendor Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above, acknowledging their full understanding and acceptance of all terms, conditions, and covenants contained herein. Each signatory warrants that they are duly authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of their respective entity, thereby binding that entity to the obligations and responsibilities set forth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR [CLIENT COMPANY NAME]:</strong></p>\n<p>___________________________________</p>\n<p>By: [Authorized Signatory Name]</p>\n<p>Title: [Authorized Signatory Title]</p>\n<p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR [VENDOR NAME]:</strong></p>\n<p>___________________________________</p>\n<p>By: [Authorized Signatory Name]</p>\n<p>Title: [Authorized Signatory Title]</p>\n<p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>WITNESSES:</strong></p>\n\n<p>___________________________________</p>\n<p>Witness Name (for [CLIENT COMPANY NAME])</p>\n<p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n\n<p>___________________________________</p>\n<p>Witness Name (for [VENDOR NAME])</p>\n<p>Date: _____________________________</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

DEFINITIONS</h2>\n        <p>\n            For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below:\n            \"Products\" means the [specific product/material type, e.g., \"widgets,\" \"steel sheets,\" \"electronic components\"] and any other goods or materials specified in a Purchase Order issued by Buyer and accepted by Supplier under the terms of this Agreement. This definition encompasses all variations, configurations, and quantities of such goods, including any associated documentation, packaging, or accessories, as may be detailed in the specifications attached hereto as Exhibit A or referenced in individual Purchase Orders.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            \"Purchase Order\" or \"PO\" means a written order issued by Buyer to Supplier for the procurement of Products, which shall, at a minimum, specify the type, quantity, price, requested delivery date, and delivery location of the Products. Each Purchase Order, upon acceptance by Supplier, shall become a binding contract incorporating the terms of this Agreement by reference, and no additional or different terms or conditions contained in any Purchase Order or other communication shall be binding upon Buyer unless expressly agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Buyer.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT AND PRODUCT SUPPLY</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement sets forth the exclusive terms and conditions under which Supplier shall supply, and Buyer shall purchase, the Products. Supplier agrees to use its best efforts to meet Buyer's requirements for the Products, including but not limited to, maintaining sufficient inventory levels, production capacity, and logistical capabilities to fulfill all accepted Purchase Orders in a timely and efficient manner. This commitment extends to ensuring the continuous availability of specified raw materials and components necessary for the manufacture or procurement of the Products.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Parties acknowledge that specific details regarding Product specifications, pricing, and delivery schedules will be further elaborated in individual Purchase Orders issued by Buyer and accepted by Supplier. However, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail, unless the Purchase Order explicitly states an intent to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement and is signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>3. PURCHASE ORDERS</h2>\n        <p>\n            Buyer shall issue Purchase Orders to Supplier for the Products it wishes to procure. Each Purchase Order shall be deemed an offer by Buyer to purchase Products in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Supplier shall accept or reject a Purchase Order within [Number] business days of receipt. Failure by Supplier to respond within this timeframe shall be deemed an acceptance of the Purchase Order. Accepted Purchase Orders shall be binding on both Parties, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Any modifications to an accepted Purchase Order must be mutually agreed upon in writing by both Parties. Buyer reserves the right to cancel any Purchase Order, in whole or in part, without penalty, prior to Supplier's acceptance. If Buyer cancels an accepted Purchase Order, Buyer shall be liable only for Supplier's direct, documented costs incurred specifically for the canceled portion of the order prior to the cancellation notice, provided Supplier takes all reasonable steps to mitigate such costs.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>4. DELIVERY SCHEDULES</h2>\n        <p>\n            Supplier shall deliver the Products to the destination specified in each Purchase Order by the requested delivery date (\"Delivery Date\"). Time is of the essence for all deliveries under this Agreement. Supplier shall provide Buyer with a confirmed delivery schedule within [Number] business days of accepting a Purchase Order, including estimated shipping dates and tracking information where applicable. Supplier shall notify Buyer immediately of any actual or potential delays in delivery, providing a revised delivery schedule and the reasons for the delay.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the event of any delay attributable to Supplier, Buyer reserves the right, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, to: (a) cancel the affected Purchase Order without penalty; (b) procure substitute Products from an alternative source and charge Supplier for any excess costs incurred; or (c) require Supplier to expedite shipment at Supplier's sole expense. Risk of loss and title to the Products shall pass to Buyer upon delivery to the specified destination and Buyer's acceptance of the Products, following inspection in accordance with Section 5.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>5. QUALITY STANDARDS AND INSPECTION</h2>\n        <p>\n            Supplier warrants that all Products supplied hereunder shall strictly conform to the specifications, drawings, samples, and quality standards (collectively, \"Quality Standards\") set forth in Exhibit A or otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties. Products shall be new, of the highest quality, free from defects in material and workmanship, and fit for the purpose for which they are intended. Supplier shall implement and maintain a robust quality control system to ensure compliance with all Quality Standards and shall provide Buyer with access to relevant quality documentation upon request.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Buyer shall have the right to inspect all Products upon delivery or at any reasonable time thereafter. Buyer may reject any Products that do not conform to the Quality Standards or are otherwise defective. Buyer shall notify Supplier of any non-conforming Products within [Number] business days of discovery. Supplier shall, at Buyer's option and at Supplier's sole expense, promptly replace or repair any rejected Products. If replacement or repair is not commercially practicable or timely, Buyer may return the non-conforming Products to Supplier for a full refund, or Buyer may, at its option, repair or rework the Products and charge Supplier for all associated costs.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. PAYMENT TERMS</h2>\n        <p>\n            Buyer shall pay Supplier for Products delivered and accepted in accordance with the prices set forth in the applicable Purchase Order. Supplier shall submit invoices to Buyer upon delivery and acceptance of the Products. Each invoice shall reference the corresponding Purchase Order number and include a detailed description of the Products, quantity, unit price, and total amount due. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoices within [Number] days from the date of Buyer's receipt of a correct invoice.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            All payments shall be made in [Currency, e.g., United States Dollars] via [Payment Method, e.g., electronic funds transfer]. Buyer reserves the right to offset any amounts owed by Supplier to Buyer against any amounts payable by Buyer to Supplier under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties. In the event of a disputed invoice, Buyer shall pay the undisputed portion and the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the disputed amount within [Number] days. Late payments, if not disputed in good faith, may be subject to interest at the rate of [Percentage]% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, calculated from the due date until the date of payment.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. PRICING</h2>\n        <p>\n            The prices for the Products shall be as set forth in Exhibit B, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing in individual Purchase Orders. Unless otherwise specified, all prices are firm and fixed for a period of [Number] months from the Effective Date and include all costs for materials, labor, overhead, packaging, insurance, and freight to the Buyer's designated delivery location. Supplier shall not increase prices without Buyer's prior written consent.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Any proposed price adjustments by Supplier must be submitted to Buyer in writing at least [Number] days prior to the effective date of such adjustment, accompanied by detailed justification. Buyer reserves the right to renegotiate prices or seek alternative suppliers if proposed price increases are deemed unacceptable. All prices are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, excise, or similar taxes, which shall be separately stated on invoices and borne by Buyer, unless Buyer provides a valid exemption certificate.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8. WARRANTIES</h2>\n        <p>\n            Supplier warrants that for a period of [Number] months from the date of acceptance by Buyer, all Products supplied under this Agreement will be (a) free from defects in design, material, and workmanship; (b) conform strictly to all specifications, drawings, samples, and other requirements provided by Buyer; (c) be new and of merchantable quality; (d) be fit for the particular purpose for which they are intended, as communicated by Buyer to Supplier; and (e) be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims.

Supplier shall bear all costs associated with the return of non-conforming Products and the shipment of repaired or replacement Products. The foregoing remedies are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies available to Buyer at law or in equity, including but not limited to, damages for breach of contract.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>9.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>\n        <p>\n            All intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and industrial designs, existing prior to the Effective Date and owned by a Party shall remain the sole property of that Party.

The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of such event and its expected duration.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Party affected by the Force Majeure Event shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the event and to resume performance as soon as practicable.

Each Party waives any objection to the laying of venue in such courts and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>\n        <p>\n            In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof (\"Dispute\"), the Parties agree to first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations between their respective senior management. Either Party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party, and the Parties shall meet within [Number] days of such notice to attempt to resolve the Dispute.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If the Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within [Number] days, the Parties agree to submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation administered by [Arbitration/Mediation Service, e.g., the American Arbitration Association] in accordance with its then-current Commercial Mediation Procedures.

Licensor possesses all necessary rights, titles, and interests in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights, to grant the licenses and rights contemplated herein.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            WHEREAS, Distributor possesses expertise and established channels in the distribution of software products within the specified territory and desires to obtain the right to market, distribute, and sublicense the Software to end-users in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Distributor acknowledges its understanding of the Software's technical specifications and target market.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>\n        <p>\n            <b>1.1. \"Software\"</b> means all versions of Licensor's proprietary software product known as \"[Software Product Name],\" including all modules, components, features, updates, upgrades, enhancements, modifications, new versions, and related documentation (whether in print or electronic format) provided by Licensor to Distributor under this Agreement. This definition explicitly includes any application programming interfaces (APIs), development kits, or other tools provided for integration or use with the primary software product.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Software also encompasses any future products or services that Licensor may designate in writing as falling under the scope of this Agreement, along with any associated intellectual property rights, trade secrets, and confidential information related to its design, functionality, and operation. It is understood that the Software is licensed, not sold, and remains the exclusive property of Licensor.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            <b>1.2. \"Territory\"</b> means the geographic region defined as [Specify Countries/Regions, e.g., \"the United States of America and Canada\"]. Distributor's rights to market, distribute, and sublicense the Software are strictly limited to End Users located within this specified Territory.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Any sales or marketing activities outside the defined Territory are expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Licensor, which may be granted or withheld at Licensor's sole discretion. Should the Territory be expanded or modified, such changes must be formalized through a written amendment to this Agreement, duly executed by both parties.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            <b>1.3. \"End User\"</b> means any individual, corporation, or other entity that acquires a license to use the Software directly or indirectly from Distributor for its own internal business purposes and not for further distribution or resale. An End User must agree to Licensor's standard End User License Agreement (EULA) prior to or upon installation and use of the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Distributor shall ensure that all End Users are provided with and accept the EULA, and Distributor shall not make any representations or warranties to End Users that are inconsistent with or exceed those contained in the EULA or this Agreement. Distributor is responsible for the collection of all necessary End User acceptance records.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>2. Term</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of [Number] ([Number]) years (\"Initial Term\"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. The Initial Term is designed to allow both parties sufficient time to establish and evaluate the distribution relationship.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (\"Renewal Term\"), unless either party provides written notice of its intent not to renew at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Any non-renewal notice must be clear and unambiguous regarding the party's intent to terminate the contractual relationship at the end of the current period.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>3. Grant of Rights</h2>\n        <p>\n            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Distributor a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to market, promote, distribute, and sublicense the Software to End Users within the Territory. This right is strictly limited to the distribution of the Software in its object code form, and Distributor is expressly prohibited from decompiling, reverse engineering, or modifying the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Distributor's right to sublicense is contingent upon each End User agreeing to a valid End User License Agreement (EULA) provided or approved by Licensor, which shall protect Licensor's intellectual property rights and limit Licensor's liability to the fullest extent permitted by law. Distributor shall not create any warranties or obligations on behalf of Licensor beyond those expressly stated in the EULA or this Agreement, and any such unauthorized representations shall be the sole responsibility of Distributor.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>4. Pricing and Payment Terms</h2>\n        <p>\n            Distributor shall purchase licenses for the Software from Licensor at the wholesale prices set forth in Licensor's then-current Distributor Price List, attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference. Licensor reserves the right to update the Distributor Price List periodically, provided that any price changes shall not apply to orders placed and accepted prior to the effective date of such change, and Licensor shall provide Distributor with at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice of any price adjustments.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Payment for all Software licenses shall be due within thirty (30) days from the date of Licensor's invoice. All payments shall be made in United States Dollars (USD) via wire transfer to an account designated by Licensor. Overdue payments shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, calculated from the due date until paid in full. Distributor is solely responsible for all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes (excluding taxes on Licensor's income) arising from the distribution and sublicensing of the Software.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>5. Support Obligations</h2>\n        <p>\n            Distributor shall provide first-line technical support to End Users for the Software within the Territory. This includes, but is not limited to, responding to initial inquiries, troubleshooting common issues, and providing basic guidance on Software usage. Distributor's support personnel shall be adequately trained by Licensor to perform these functions effectively, and Distributor shall maintain a reasonable level of staffing to meet End User support demands.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            For issues that Distributor cannot resolve, Distributor shall escalate such issues to Licensor's second-line support team in accordance with Licensor's then-current support escalation procedures, which will be provided to Distributor. Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve escalated issues in a timely manner. Licensor shall also provide Distributor with access to its knowledge base, technical documentation, and any relevant training materials to assist Distributor in fulfilling its first-line support obligations.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>\n        <p>\n            During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, each party (\"Receiving Party\") shall maintain in strict confidence all non-public information disclosed by the other party (\"Disclosing Party\") that is designated as confidential or that, by its nature, would reasonably be understood to be confidential (\"Confidential Information\"). Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the Software (including its source code and design), business plans, financial data, customer lists, marketing strategies, and technical specifications.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Receiving Party shall use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent, except to its employees, contractors, or agents who have a need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those herein. The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>\n        <p>\n            Distributor acknowledges that all intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and any other proprietary rights in and to the Software, including all modifications, enhancements, and derivative works thereof, are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Licensor. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting Distributor any ownership interest in the Software or any of Licensor's intellectual property.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Licensor's ownership of the Software and its intellectual property rights. Distributor agrees to promptly notify Licensor of any actual or suspected infringement of Licensor's intellectual property rights by any third party of which Distributor becomes aware. Distributor shall cooperate fully with Licensor, at Licensor's expense, in any action Licensor deems necessary to protect its intellectual property rights.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8. Warranties</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor warrants that it has the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to grant the rights herein granted. Licensor further warrants that the Software, when used in accordance with its documentation, will perform substantially in accordance with its specifications. This warranty is contingent upon proper installation and use of the Software and does not cover issues arising from misuse, unauthorized modifications, or use with unapproved third-party products.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 8, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND LICENSOR MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT ALL DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. DISTRIBUTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS NOT RELIED ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE BY LICENSOR, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>\n        <p>\n            Distributor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with (a) Distributor's breach of any of its obligations, representations, or warranties under this Agreement; (b) any misrepresentation or unauthorized warranty made by Distributor to an End User regarding the Software; (c) any claims by End Users arising from Distributor's acts or omissions; or (d) Distributor's negligence or willful misconduct.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Distributor from and against any third-party claim that the Software, as provided by Licensor and used in accordance with this Agreement, infringes any valid patent, copyright, or trademark of such third party. Licensor's indemnification obligations are conditioned upon Distributor (a) promptly notifying Licensor in writing of any such claim; (b) granting Licensor sole control of the defense and settlement thereof; and (c) providing reasonable assistance to Licensor at Licensor's expense. Licensor shall have no liability for any infringement claim arising from (i) use of the Software in combination with other products not supplied by Licensor; (ii) modification of the Software by anyone other than Licensor; or (iii) use of an outdated version of the Software if an updated, non-infringing version was provided by Licensor.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n        <p>\n            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY DISTRIBUTOR TO LICENSOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO DISTRIBUTOR.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>11. Termination</h2>\n        <p>\n            Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice thereof. A material breach includes, but is not limited to, failure to make timely payments, unauthorized distribution of the Software, or breach of confidentiality obligations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Distributor shall immediately cease all marketing, promotion, distribution, and sublicensing of the Software, and shall return or destroy all copies of the Software and any related documentation and Confidential Information in its possession. All outstanding payment obligations shall become immediately due and payable. Sections 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State, e.g., Delaware], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. This choice of law is intended to be comprehensive and to govern all aspects of the Agreement, including its formation, interpretation, performance, and enforcement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The parties expressly exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [County, State, e.g., New Castle County, Delaware], and the parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n        <p>\n            Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be attempted to be resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within a period of sixty (60) days from the date one party notifies the other of a dispute, then either party may initiate formal dispute resolution.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            All disputes that cannot be resolved amicably shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in [City, State, e.g., Wilmington, Delaware] by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The language of the arbitration shall be English.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>\n        <p>\n            <b>14.1. Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement, including any exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, negotiations, representations, or communications, whether written or oral. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>14.2. Assignment.</b> Neither party may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor may assign this Agreement without Distributor's consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>14.3.

Severability.</b> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

Waiver.</b> No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to in writing.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Distribution Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above.</p>\n\n        <table style=\"width: 100%; border: none;\">\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-right: 20pt;\">\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 30pt;\"><b>LICENSOR:</b></p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt;\">____________________________________</p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt;\">By: [Authorized Signatory Name]</p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt;\">Title: [Title]</p>\n                    <p>Date: ____________________________________</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-left: 20pt;\">\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 30pt;\"><b>DISTRIBUTOR:</b></p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt;\">____________________________________</p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt;\">By: [Authorized Signatory Name]</p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 5pt;\">Title: [Title]</p>\n                    <p>Date: ____________________________________</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Within [Number] ([e.g., thirty (30)]) days of such notice, senior executives from each Party, with authority to settle the Dispute, shall meet at a mutually agreed location or via teleconference to attempt to resolve the Dispute. All discussions, offers, and statements made during these negotiations shall be confidential and inadmissible in any subsequent arbitration or judicial proceeding.</p>\n        <p><strong>14.2. Arbitration.</strong> If the Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within [Number] ([e.g., sixty (60)]) days of the initial notice, the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Institution, e.g., the American Arbitration Association (AAA)] in accordance with its [Specific Rules, e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules] then in effect. The arbitration shall be conducted by [Number] ([e.g., one (1)]) arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or failing agreement, appointed by the AAA. The seat of the arbitration shall be [City, State/Country, e.g., Wilmington, Delaware, USA], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The costs of arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees, shall be borne equally by the Parties, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.</p>\n\n        <h2>15. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h2>\n        <p><strong>15.1. Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, between the Parties relating to such subject matter. No representations, warranties, covenants, or conditions, other than those expressly set forth herein, have been made or relied upon by either Party. This clause ensures that the written document is the complete and final expression of the Parties' intent, preventing reliance on extrinsic statements.</p>\n        <p><strong>15.2. Amendments.</strong> No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties. Any waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or of any other provision of this Agreement. This requirement for written amendments ensures clarity and mutual consent for any changes to the contractual terms, preventing informal or implied modifications that could lead to future disputes.</p>\n        <p><strong>15.3. Notices.</strong> All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when: (a) delivered personally; (b) sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; (c) sent by nationally recognized overnight courier service (e.g., FedEx, UPS); or (d) sent by email with confirmation of receipt, to the addresses set forth below or to such other address as either Party may designate by written notice to the other Party. Proper notice is critical for formal communications and the commencement of various contractual processes, including termination or dispute resolution.</p>\n        <p><strong>15.4. Assignment.</strong> Neither Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

This clause protects the Parties' interests by ensuring that the Joint Venture relationship is maintained with the original contracting entities or approved successors.</p>\n        <p><strong>15.5. Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The Parties shall endeavor to replace the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the original intent of the Parties. This ensures that the bulk of the agreement remains enforceable even if a specific clause is deemed problematic, preserving the overall contractual relationship.</p>\n        <p><strong>15.6. Force Majeure.</strong> Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused by an event beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, epidemics, pandemics, or strikes (\"Force Majeure Event\"). The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other Party of the occurrence and the anticipated duration of such event and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding [Number] ([e.g., ninety (90)]) days, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party, without further liability, except for obligations accrued prior to the Force Majeure Event.</p>\n\n        <h2>SIGNATURES</h2>\n        <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Joint Venture Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above.</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-right: 10pt;\">\n                    <p><strong>[Company A]</strong></p>\n                    <p>By: ______________________________</p>\n                    <p>Name: [Printed Name of Signatory]</p>\n                    <p>Title: [Title of Signatory]</p>\n                    <p>Date: ______________________________</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-left: 10pt;\">\n                    <p><strong>[Company B]</strong></p>\n                    <p>By: ______________________________</p>\n                    <p>Name: [Printed Name of Signatory]</p>\n                    <p>Title: [Title of Signatory]</p>\n                    <p>Date: ______________________________</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, if such Event of Default is capable of being cured, the [Borrower] shall have a period of [Number] ([Number]) days from the date of receipt of such notice to cure the default to the satisfaction of the [Lender].

Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced.

Term</h2>\n<p>This Non-Binding Term Sheet (the \"Term Sheet\") shall become effective on the [Effective Date] and shall remain open for acceptance and negotiation for a period of [Number] ([Number] days/weeks) from the Effective Date, unless extended by mutual written agreement of all parties or earlier terminated as provided herein. During this period, [Party A] (the \"Investor\") and [Party B] (the \"Company\") shall endeavor to negotiate in good faith and execute definitive legal documentation consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Term Sheet. It is expressly understood that, notwithstanding the non-binding nature of the majority of this Term Sheet, the provisions related to confidentiality, exclusivity (if any), governing law, and expenses shall be legally binding and survive any expiration or termination of this Term Sheet. Should definitive agreements not be executed within the specified term, this Term Sheet shall automatically expire, and neither party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder, save for those provisions explicitly designated as binding.</p>\n<h2>3. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>\n    Except as otherwise provided herein, the existence and the terms of this Term Sheet, including any discussions, negotiations, or proposals related thereto, shall be considered confidential information. Each party, including [Investor Name] (the \"Investor\") and [Company Name] (the \"Company\"), agrees to keep such information strictly confidential and not to disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party, except to its legal, financial, and other professional advisors who are bound by similar confidentiality obligations, or as may be required by law, regulation, or court order. The parties further agree to use any information exchanged during the course of these negotiations solely for the purpose of evaluating the potential investment opportunity outlined herein and for no other purpose whatsoever. This confidentiality obligation shall survive the termination of discussions and remain in full force and effect for a period of [Number] years from the Effective Date of this Term Sheet, or indefinitely for trade secrets and proprietary information.

The Company further represents that its operations, products, and services do not infringe upon, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property rights of any third party.

There are no outstanding or threatened claims, litigation, or proceedings alleging infringement, misappropriation, or violation by the Company of any third-party Intellectual Property rights, nor are there any claims challenging the Company's ownership or rights in its own Intellectual Property. The Company has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect its confidential information and trade secrets, and no material Intellectual Property of the Company is subject to any lien, encumbrance, or license that would materially impair the Company's ability to operate its business as contemplated.</p>\n<h2>5. Warranties</h2>\n<p>The Company represents and warrants to the Investor that, as of the [Effective Date] and for the purpose of facilitating the discussions and due diligence contemplated by this non-binding Term Sheet, all material information provided to the Investor concerning the Company, its operations, financial condition, and prospects, including but not limited to the capitalization table, financial projections, and business plan, is true, accurate, and complete in all material respects and does not contain any material misstatement or omit any material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein not misleading. The Company further warrants that it has the full corporate power and authority to enter into this Term Sheet and to carry out its obligations as contemplated herein, and that the execution and delivery of this Term Sheet does not violate its organizational documents or any agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound. These warranties are made solely for the preliminary evaluation by the Investor and shall not be construed as the comprehensive representations and warranties that will be required and negotiated in any definitive investment agreement, which will be subject to extensive legal, financial, and business due diligence by the Investor.</p>\n<h2>6. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>The Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless [The Investor(s)] and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors, and assigns (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred by the Indemnified Parties arising out of or in connection with:</p>\n<p>(a) Any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company in the definitive investment agreements (including, without limitation, the Stock Purchase Agreement, Shareholders' Agreement, and Articles of Association) to be executed pursuant to this Term Sheet;</p>\n<p>(b) Any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement, or obligation on the part of the Company contained in such definitive investment agreements;</p>\n<p>(c) Any action, suit, proceeding, claim, or demand brought by a third party against any Indemnified Party arising from the Company's operations, business, or assets, including, without limitation, any claims related to intellectual property infringement, product liability, regulatory non-compliance, or employee-related matters;</p>\n<p>provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any indemnification hereunder to the extent that such losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses are caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of such Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the closing of the investment and the termination of this Term Sheet, to the extent applicable to the definitive agreements, and shall be fully enforceable upon the execution of the definitive agreements.</p>\n<h2>7. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Term Sheet, with the exception of the provisions contained in Sections [e.g., 8. Confidentiality], [e.g., 9. Governing Law], and [e.g., 10. Non-Binding Nature], which shall be legally binding and survive any expiration or termination of this Term Sheet, is intended solely as a non-binding outline of the principal terms and conditions for a potential investment. This non-binding offer shall automatically expire and be of no further force or effect if definitive investment agreements, including but not limited to a Share Subscription Agreement, Shareholders' Agreement, and amended Articles of Association, are not executed by [Date, e.g., 30 days from Effective Date] or such other date as mutually agreed upon in writing by [Party A] (the \"Company\") and [Party B] (the \"Investor\"). Prior to the execution of such definitive agreements, either the Company or the Investor may, at its sole discretion and without liability to the other party (except for breaches of the binding provisions), terminate discussions regarding the proposed investment at any time and for any reason, or no reason. Upon such termination of discussions or expiration of this Term Sheet, neither party shall have any obligation to the other with respect to the proposed investment, except for obligations arising under the aforementioned binding provisions.</p>\n<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Term Sheet, while largely non-binding in its entirety, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State of Governing Law], United States of America, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [State of Governing Law] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [State of Governing Law]. The parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in [County, State of Governing Law] for any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Term Sheet, including, without limitation, any disputes regarding the enforceability of any binding provisions herein. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit, or proceeding in any such court and any claim that any such action, suit, or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>This Term Sheet is non-binding, except for the provisions of this Section 9 (Dispute Resolution), Section 10 (Confidentiality), Section 11 (Expenses), and Section 12 (Governing Law), which shall be legally binding upon the parties. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these binding provisions, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between [Party A] and the Investors for a period of thirty (30) days from the date one party notifies the other of a dispute. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, the parties agree to engage in non-binding mediation with a mutually agreed-upon mediator. Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of the initial notification, the dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the [Arbitration Rules] in accordance with its rules. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with said rules. The seat of arbitration shall be [Arbitration Location], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<h2>10.

This Term Sheet is intended solely to facilitate further discussion and is not a legally binding agreement, except for the provisions set forth in Section 10 (Confidentiality), Section 11 (Expenses), Section 12 (Governing Law), Section 13 (Non-Binding Nature), and Section 14 (Expiration), which shall be legally binding upon the parties.</p>\n\n        <p>The parties acknowledge that this Term Sheet represents a framework for a potential future transaction and that a definitive agreement will be subject to satisfactory due diligence, negotiation, and execution of comprehensive legal documentation, including but not limited to a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, a Note, and any other ancillary agreements deemed necessary by the parties.</p>\n\n        <h2>Parties</h2>\n        <p><strong>Investor:</strong> [Investor Name/Entity Name]<br>\n        [Investor Address]<br>\n        [Investor Contact Person]<br>\n        [Investor Email]</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Company:</strong> [Company Legal Name], a [State of Incorporation] corporation<br>\n        [Company Address]<br>\n        [Company Contact Person]<br>\n        [Company Email]<br>\n        Industry: [Industry e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Fintech]</p>\n\n        <h2>1. Key Investment Terms</h2>\n        <p><strong>Investment Amount:</strong> The Investor proposes to invest [$X] (e.g., One Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in the Company. This amount represents the total principal sum to be provided by the Investor to the Company in exchange for the convertible instruments outlined herein, subject to the terms and conditions of the definitive agreements.</p>\n        <p>This investment is intended to provide critical seed capital for the Company's initial operational phases, product development, and market entry strategies. The final disbursement of funds will be contingent upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the execution of all definitive legal documentation and any other conditions precedent mutually agreed upon by both parties.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Form of Investment:</strong> Convertible Note. The investment will be structured as a convertible promissory note (\"Note\") issued by the Company to the Investor. This Note will automatically convert into equity of the Company upon the occurrence of certain predefined events, primarily a Qualified Equity Financing or a Change of Control event, as further detailed in the definitive Note Purchase Agreement.</p>\n        <p>The use of a convertible note structure is designed to defer a precise valuation of the Company until a later equity financing round, providing flexibility for both the Company and the Investor during this early stage. The specific terms of conversion, including any applicable discount rates or valuation caps, will be meticulously detailed in the final Note and the associated Convertible Note Purchase Agreement.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> [X]% per annum, compounded annually. Interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal balance of the Note from the date of issuance until the Note is converted into equity, repaid, or otherwise satisfied. This interest will be capitalized and convert along with the principal amount.</p>\n        <p>The accrued interest will not be paid in cash but will instead increase the principal amount of the Note, thereby increasing the number of equity securities the Investor will receive upon conversion. This capitalization mechanism ensures that the Investor receives a return on their investment even before a liquidity event or equity financing occurs, aligning the interests of both parties.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Maturity Date:</strong> [X] months from the issuance date (e.g., 24 months). On the Maturity Date, if the Note has not yet converted into equity, the outstanding principal amount plus all accrued and unpaid interest shall become due and payable by the Company to the Investor, unless otherwise agreed by the Investor.</p>\n        <p>In the event the Company is unable to repay the Note on the Maturity Date, the parties may mutually agree to extend the Maturity Date, convert the Note into equity at a pre-determined valuation, or explore other mutually agreeable solutions. This provision provides a clear timeline for the investment and a mechanism for resolution if a conversion event does not occur within the anticipated timeframe.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Discount Rate:</strong> [X]% (e.g., 20%) on the price per share of the Qualified Equity Financing. Upon conversion in a Qualified Equity Financing, the Investor's Note will convert at a discount to the price paid by new investors in that financing round. This discount rewards the early-stage Investor for the higher risk taken.</p>\n        <p>The application of this discount rate ensures that the Investor receives a more favorable conversion price compared to later-stage investors, reflecting their early commitment and the inherent risks associated with seed-stage investments. The calculation of the conversion price will be explicitly defined in the definitive convertible note agreement to avoid any ambiguity.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>Valuation Cap:</strong> $[Y] (e.g., $5,000,000) pre-money. The conversion of the Note into equity will occur at the lower of the price resulting from the Discount Rate or the price implied by the Valuation Cap. This cap sets an upper limit on the pre-money valuation at which the Note can convert, protecting the Investor from excessive dilution if the Company's valuation increases significantly before conversion.</p>\n        <p>The Valuation Cap provides the Investor with a guaranteed maximum valuation for their conversion, ensuring a minimum ownership percentage irrespective of how high the Company's valuation climbs in a subsequent financing round. This mechanism is crucial for early-stage investors seeking to mitigate the risk of high valuations in later rounds that could significantly dilute their initial investment.</p>\n\n        <h2>2. Governance & Rights</h2>\n        <p><strong>Information Rights:</strong> The Company shall provide the Investor with customary information rights, including but not limited to, annual audited financial statements, quarterly unaudited financial statements, and annual operating budgets. These reports shall be provided within a reasonable timeframe following the end of the respective periods.</p>\n        <p>The Investor shall also have the right to reasonable access to the Company's management and facilities during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice, provided such access does not unduly interfere with the Company's operations. These rights are granted to ensure transparency and allow the Investor to monitor the Company's financial performance and strategic progress effectively.</p>\n\n        <h2>3. Confidentiality</h2>\n        <p>Each party agrees to keep confidential all non-public information disclosed by the other party in connection with this Term Sheet and the proposed transaction, whether written or oral, and to use such information solely for the purpose of evaluating and negotiating the proposed transaction. This obligation shall survive the expiration or termination of this Term Sheet.</p>\n        <p>This confidentiality obligation does not apply to information that is publicly available, independently developed, or required to be disclosed by law. The parties further agree to take all reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of such information, including ensuring that their respective representatives, employees, and advisors are bound by similar confidentiality obligations.</p>\n\n        <h2>4. Expenses</h2>\n        <p>Each party shall bear its own legal, accounting, and other expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, and execution of this Term Sheet and the definitive agreements. No party shall be liable to the other for any such expenses, regardless of whether the proposed transaction is consummated.</p>\n        <p>This provision clarifies that there will be no reimbursement of expenses between the parties for the costs associated with due diligence or legal drafting related to this potential investment. It ensures that both parties are responsible for their own internal and external costs incurred during the exploratory and negotiation phases of this non-binding arrangement.</p>\n\n        <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>\n        <p>This Term Sheet shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State, e.g., Delaware], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Term Sheet shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in [County, State, e.g., Santa Clara County, California].</p>\n        <p>The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection to venue in such courts. This choice of law and jurisdiction ensures clarity and predictability in the event of any legal interpretation or dispute concerning the binding provisions of this Term Sheet, providing a consistent legal framework for engagement.</p>\n\n        <h2>6. Non-Binding Nature</h2>\n        <p>Except for Sections 3 (Confidentiality), 4 (Expenses), 5 (Governing Law), 6 (Non-Binding Nature), and 7 (Expiration), this Term Sheet is non-binding and does not create any legal obligation on the part of either the Investor or the Company to enter into the proposed transaction or any definitive agreement. A binding agreement will only exist upon the execution of definitive legal documents.</p>\n        <p>This explicit statement is crucial to ensure that neither party can claim a binding commitment based solely on the terms outlined herein. The parties acknowledge that the proposed transaction is subject to, among other things, satisfactory due diligence, corporate approvals, and the negotiation and execution of comprehensive definitive agreements that fully detail all terms and conditions.</p>\n\n        <h2>7. Expiration</h2>\n        <p>This Term Sheet shall expire and be of no further force or effect if definitive agreements are not executed by [Date, e.g., 30 days from signing] unless extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. Upon expiration, the non-binding provisions of this Term Sheet shall cease to have any effect, while the binding provisions shall continue in full force and effect as specified.</p>\n        <p>This expiration clause provides a clear timeframe for the negotiation and execution of the definitive investment documents. It encourages timely progression of discussions and due diligence, while also providing a mechanism for either party to disengage if the process extends beyond a reasonable period without reaching a conclusive agreement.</p>\n\n        <p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Non-Binding Investor Term Sheet as of the date first written above.</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p><strong>INVESTOR:</strong></p>\n                    <p>_______________________________<br>\n                    [Investor Name/Entity Name]<br>\n                    By: _____________________________<br>\n                    Name: [Authorized Signatory Name]<br>\n                    Title: [Authorized Signatory Title]<br>\n                    Date: ___________________________</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p><strong>COMPANY:</strong></p>\n                    <p>_______________________________<br>\n                    [Company Legal Name]<br>\n                    By: _____________________________<br>\n                    Name: [Authorized Signatory Name]<br>\n                    Title: [Authorized Signatory Title]<br>\n                    Date: ___________________________</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Subscription Agreement (this \"Agreement\"), unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Agreement\"</strong> means this Subscription Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits attached hereto, as may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Company\"</strong> means [Full Legal Name of Company], a [State/Jurisdiction of Incorporation] corporation, with its principal place of business located at [Company's Address], which is offering the Shares for subscription hereunder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Investor\"</strong> or <strong>\"Subscriber\"</strong> means each individual or entity executing this Agreement as a subscriber for Shares, as identified in Schedule A, who is subscribing for the Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Shares\"</strong> means the [Specify Class of Shares, e.g., Series A Preferred Shares] of the Company, having the rights, preferences, and privileges as set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (or equivalent governing document), as may be amended from time to time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Purchase Price\"</strong> means the aggregate amount payable by an Investor for the Shares subscribed for by such Investor, calculated at the rate of [Currency and Amount] ([e.g., $X.XX]) per Share, as specified opposite such Investor's name in Schedule A.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Closing Date\"</strong> means the date on which the subscription for Shares is completed and the Purchase Price is paid by the Investor to the Company, which shall be [Specific Date] or such other date as mutually agreed upon in writing by the Company and the Investor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Effective Date\"</strong> means the date first written above, which is [Effective Date], from which date this Agreement shall be deemed to be in full force and effect.</p>\n<h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>\n<p>The Investor, [Investor Name], hereby irrevocably agrees to pay the full aggregate purchase price for the subscribed shares (the \"Purchase Price\") as explicitly set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement, which amounts to [Purchase Price] [Currency]. This Purchase Price shall be due and payable in full by the Investor to the Company, [Company Name], on or before the [Effective Date] (the \"Payment Due Date\").</p>\n<p>Payment shall be made exclusively by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in [Currency], to the Company's designated bank account. The Company shall provide the Investor with the specific bank details, including but not limited to the Bank Name: [Bank Name], Account Name: [Account Name], Account Number: [Account Number], and ABA Routing Number: [ABA Routing Number] (or SWIFT/BIC Code: [SWIFT/BIC Code] for international transfers), no later than [Number] business days prior to the Payment Due Date.</p>\n<p>The Investor acknowledges and agrees that no shares shall be issued, allotted, or delivered, nor shall any rights or benefits associated with such shares accrue to the Investor, until the Company has received the full Purchase Price in cleared and immediately available funds.

Warranties</h2>\n<p>Each Investor, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to [Company Name] (the \"Company\") as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, that:</p>\n<p>a. **Authority; Enforceability.** Such Investor has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and any other documents required to be executed by such Investor in connection herewith, and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of such Investor, enforceable against such Investor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, or by general principles of equity.</p>\n<p>b. **No Conflicts.** The execution, delivery, and performance by such Investor of this Agreement and the consummation by such Investor of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) violate any provision of the organizational documents of such Investor, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any agreement or instrument to which such Investor is a party or by which it is bound, or (iii) violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, or decree applicable to such Investor.</p>\n<p>c. **Accredited Investor Status.** Such Investor is an \"accredited investor\" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and has accurately completed and signed the Investor Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit A. Such Investor understands that the Shares are being offered and sold in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and that the Company is relying upon the truth and accuracy of the representations and warranties contained herein and in the Investor Questionnaire to establish the availability of such exemptions.</p>\n<p>d. **Investment Purpose.** Such Investor is acquiring the Shares for its own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of selling or otherwise disposing of the Shares. Such Investor understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and therefore cannot be sold or transferred unless they are registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.</p>\n<p>e. **Sophistication; Risk Acknowledgment.** Such Investor has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Company, and is able to bear the economic risk of such investment, including the complete loss of its investment. Such Investor has had the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Company concerning the terms and conditions of this investment and to obtain any additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of any information furnished to it, to the extent the Company possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense.</p>\n<p>f. **Financial Condition.** Such Investor has adequate means of providing for its current needs and contingencies and has no need for liquidity with respect to its investment in the Company. The financial condition of such Investor is such that it can afford to bear the entire loss of its investment in the Company.</p>\n<h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>\n    The Investor acknowledges that in connection with its evaluation of the Company and the execution of this Subscription Agreement, it has received and will continue to receive certain confidential, proprietary, and non-public information concerning the Company, its business, operations, financial condition, products, services, and strategies (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). The Investor agrees to keep all such Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, nor use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the evaluation of the investment contemplated by this Agreement and the exercise of its rights as an investor in the Company.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The foregoing confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Investor or its representatives; (b) was available to the Investor on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Company; (c) becomes available to the Investor on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company, provided that such source is not, to the best of the Investor's knowledge, bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided that the Investor provides prompt written notice to the Company prior to such disclosure, if legally permissible, to allow the Company to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The Investor may disclose Confidential Information to its legal, financial, and accounting advisors who need to know such information for the purpose of advising the Investor regarding this investment, provided such advisors are informed of the confidential nature of the information and agree to be bound by confidentiality obligations substantially similar to those contained herein.\n</p>\n<h2>5. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>Each Investor (the \"Indemnifying Party\") hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and the cost of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, arising out of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by such Indemnifying Party in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto, or any failure by such Indemnifying Party to perform any covenant or agreement to be performed by such Indemnifying Party hereunder. This indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing of the purchase of the Shares and the termination of this Agreement. The Indemnified Parties shall provide prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any claim for which indemnification is sought; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such claim.</p>\n<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>Except for liabilities arising from fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or a material breach of the representations, warranties, or covenants expressly set forth in this Subscription Agreement, neither [Company Name] nor its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, or advisors shall be liable to the Subscriber(s) for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of data, or loss of business opportunity, arising out of or in connection with this Subscription Agreement, the purchase of the Shares, or the investment contemplated hereby. This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if [Company Name] or its representatives have been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall the aggregate liability of [Company Name] and its affiliates to any Subscriber(s) under this Agreement exceed the actual amount of the Purchase Price paid by such Subscriber(s) for the Shares subscribed hereunder. The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the limitations set forth in this Section 6 are a fundamental basis of the bargain between the parties and reflect an allocation of risk between the parties.</p>\n<h2>7. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Subscription Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing State], United States of America, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of [Governing State]. The parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within [Governing County], [Governing State] for any actions, suits, or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and agree not to commence any such action, suit, or proceeding except in such courts. Each party hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit, or proceeding in such courts and further irrevocably waives any claim that any such action, suit, or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Subscription Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiations between the Parties for a period of not less than thirty (30) days from the date one Party provides written notice of a dispute to the other. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, the Parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute through non-binding mediation administered by [Mediation Service Provider or Organization] in accordance with its then-current rules, with the costs of mediation to be shared equally by the Parties.</p>\n<p>If the dispute remains unresolved after sixty (60) days from the commencement of mediation, or if mediation is not pursued, such dispute shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the [Arbitration Rules, e.g., AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules] then in effect, by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in [Arbitration Location], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all Parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek interim or injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its rights or property pending the outcome of the arbitration.</p>\n<p>The prevailing Party in any arbitration or other legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such proceeding. This Section 8 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Subscription Agreement.</p>\n<h2>9.

Each signatory represents and warrants that they are duly authorized to execute this Agreement on behalf of the party for whom they are signing, and that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such party, enforceable in accordance with its terms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR THE COMPANY:</strong></p>\n<p>___________________________________<br/>\n[Company Name]<br/>\nBy: _______________________________<br/>\nName: [Authorized Signatory Name]<br/>\nTitle: [Authorized Signatory Title]<br/>\nDate: _____________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR EACH INVESTOR:</strong></p>\n<p>___________________________________<br/>\n[Investor Name (or Entity Name)]<br/>\nBy: _______________________________<br/>\nName: [Investor Signatory Name]<br/>\nTitle: [Investor Signatory Title, if applicable]<br/>\nDate: _____________________________</p>\n\n<p>___________________________________<br/>\n[Investor Name (or Entity Name)]<br/>\nBy: _______________________________<br/>\nName: [Investor Signatory Name]<br/>\nTitle: [Investor Signatory Title, if applicable]<br/>\nDate: _____________________________</p>\n\n<p><em>(Additional signature blocks for other investors to be added as necessary)</em></p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Convertible Note Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below:</p>\n<p><b>\"Company\"</b> means [Legal Name of Startup], a [State of Incorporation] corporation, with its principal place of business located at [Company Address], which is the issuer of this Convertible Note.</p>\n<p><b>\"Investor\"</b> means [Investor Name], a [State of Organization/Residence] [Type of Entity/Individual], with its principal address at [Investor Address], who is the purchaser of this Convertible Note and provider of the Principal Amount to the Company.</p>\n<p><b>\"Principal Amount\"</b> means the sum of [$X] Dollars ($X.00), representing the total cash consideration paid by the Investor to the Company in exchange for this Convertible Note, exclusive of any accrued interest.</p>\n<p><b>\"Qualified Financing\"</b> means a bona fide equity financing round of the Company occurring after the Effective Date and prior to the Maturity Date, in which the Company sells and issues shares of its Preferred Stock for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least [$Y] (excluding the conversion of this Note and any other convertible securities), or such lesser amount as the Company and the holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of all Convertible Notes then outstanding may agree.</p>\n<p><b>\"Valuation Cap\"</b> means the pre-money valuation of the Company set at [$Z] Dollars ($Z.00), which shall be the maximum valuation used to determine the Conversion Price per share of Preferred Stock upon a Qualified Financing, irrespective of a higher actual pre-money valuation in such financing.</p>\n<p><b>\"Discount Rate\"</b> means [Percentage]% ([Percentage]%) which shall be applied as a reduction to the price per share of Preferred Stock sold in a Qualified Financing for purposes of calculating the Conversion Price of this Note, provided that such discounted price is not lower than the price determined by the Valuation Cap.</p>\n<p><b>\"Maturity Date\"</b> means [Date, e.g., the date that is twenty-four (24) months from the Effective Date], upon which date the outstanding Principal Amount of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall become due and payable if not previously converted into equity or repaid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>2. Issuance and Principal Terms of the Note/SAFE</h2>\n<p>The Company hereby issues to [Investor Name] (the \"Holder\") a Convertible Promissory Note (the \"Note\") or a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (the \"SAFE\"), as applicable, in the principal amount of [$X] (the \"Principal Amount\"). This instrument is issued on [Effective Date] in consideration for the cash investment made by the Holder to the Company.</p>\n<p><strong>Discount:</strong> In the event of a Qualified Equity Financing (as defined herein) occurring prior to the Maturity Date (if applicable), the Principal Amount (and any accrued interest, if applicable) shall convert into Conversion Shares at a price per share equal to the lesser of (a) the price per share paid by investors in the Qualified Equity Financing, or (b) such price discounted by [Discount Rate]% (the \"Discount Rate\").</p>\n<p><strong>Valuation Cap:</strong> Alternatively, in the event of a Qualified Equity Financing, the Principal Amount (and any accrued interest, if applicable) shall convert into Conversion Shares at a price per share derived from a pre-money valuation of the Company equal to the Valuation Cap of [$Y] (the \"Valuation Cap\"), divided by the fully-diluted capitalization of the Company immediately prior to the Qualified Equity Financing. The Holder shall receive the benefit of either the Discount Rate or the Valuation Cap, whichever results in a lower effective conversion price per share for the Holder.</p>\n<p><strong>Maturity Date (Applicable to Convertible Note only):</strong> If this instrument is a Convertible Promissory Note, the entire unpaid Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall become due and payable on [Maturity Date] (the \"Maturity Date\"), unless earlier converted or repaid in accordance with the terms herein. This maturity provision is not applicable if this instrument is a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), as SAFEs do not have a maturity date.</p>\n<p><strong>Interest (Applicable to Convertible Note only):</strong> If this instrument is a Convertible Promissory Note, the Principal Amount shall bear simple interest at a rate of [Interest Rate]% per annum, computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed, commencing on the Effective Date. Interest shall be payable only upon conversion or repayment of the Note. This interest provision is not applicable if this instrument is a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), as SAFEs do not accrue interest.</p>\n<h2>3. Conversion Provisions</h2>\n<p>Upon the closing of a Qualified Financing (as defined below), the outstanding principal amount of this Note, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon (the \"Conversion Amount\"), shall automatically convert into that number of shares of the Company's capital stock issued in such Qualified Financing (the \"Conversion Shares\"). The conversion shall occur without any further action by the Investor or the Company, and the Investor shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Conversion Shares as of the closing of the Qualified Financing.</p>\n<p>A \"Qualified Financing\" shall mean the Company's next equity financing round in which the Company sells and issues shares of its Preferred Stock for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least [$X] (excluding the conversion of this Note and any other convertible securities). The \"Conversion Price\" shall be the lower of (a) the price per share of the Preferred Stock sold in the Qualified Financing multiplied by one minus the [Discount Rate]% discount (the \"Discount Price\"), or (b) the price per share derived from the [Valuation Cap] (the \"Cap Price\"). The Cap Price shall be calculated as the [Valuation Cap] divided by the Company's fully-diluted capitalization immediately prior to the Qualified Financing, which capitalization shall include all outstanding shares of capital stock, all outstanding options and warrants, and all other convertible securities on an as-converted basis, but excluding the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of this Note.</p>\n<p>The number of Conversion Shares shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount by the applicable Conversion Price. In connection with the conversion of this Note, the Investor agrees to execute and deliver to the Company all transaction documents related to such Qualified Financing, including, without limitation, any investor rights agreement, voting agreement, or other ancillary agreements, provided that such documents do not impose obligations on the Investor that are materially more burdensome than those imposed on other investors in the Qualified Financing, or that are inconsistent with the terms of this Note.</p>\n<p>No fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of this Note. If the Conversion Amount would result in the issuance of a fractional share, the number of Conversion Shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share, and the Company shall pay the Investor cash in an amount equal to the value of such fractional share based on the Conversion Price.</p>\n<h2>4. Maturity and Repayment (for Convertible Note) / Liquidation Event (for SAFE)</h2>\n<p>In the event this instrument is structured as a Convertible Note, the entire outstanding Principal Amount of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall become immediately due and payable by the Company to the Holder on the Maturity Date, which shall be [Maturity Date]. Should the Company fail to repay the Note on the Maturity Date, the outstanding Principal Amount and accrued interest shall accrue interest at a default rate of [Default Interest Rate]% per annum, compounded annually, until fully repaid or converted as per the terms herein. The Company may, at its sole discretion, elect to convert the outstanding Principal and accrued interest into equity securities of the Company at the then-applicable conversion price, provided such conversion is explicitly permitted by other provisions of this Agreement and agreed upon by the Holder.</p>\n<p>In the event this instrument is structured as a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), this instrument does not have a maturity date and does not accrue interest. However, upon a Liquidation Event occurring prior to the conversion of this SAFE, the Holder shall be entitled to receive, at the Holder’s option, either (a) a payment equal to the Purchase Amount, or (b) convert the Purchase Amount into shares of Common Stock at the Liquidation Price, which shall be calculated based on the lower of the Valuation Cap or the Discount Rate applied to the pre-money valuation of the Company immediately prior to such Liquidation Event. A \"Liquidation Event\" shall mean any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any Change of Control transaction, including without limitation, a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. In such an event, the Holder’s rights to payment or conversion shall be pari passu with all other holders of SAFE instruments of the Company and senior to holders of Common Stock, but junior to any indebtedness of the Company.</p>\n<h2>5. Representations and Warranties</h2>\n<p>Each party hereto, as of the Effective Date, hereby represents and warrants to the other party as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>5.1. Representations and Warranties of the Issuer:</strong> The Issuer represents and warrants to the Investor that:</p>\n<p>(a) The Issuer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of [State of Incorporation], and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.</p>\n<p>(b) The Issuer has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Convertible Note Agreement (or SAFE Agreement), to issue the Note (or SAFE) contemplated hereunder, and to perform its obligations hereunder.

Representations and Warranties of the Investor:</strong> The Investor represents and warrants to the Issuer that:</p>\n<p>(a) The Investor has the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Investor, enforceable against the Investor in accordance with its terms.</p>\n<p>(b) The Investor is an \"accredited investor\" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment and is able to bear the economic risk of such investment.</p>\n<p>(c) The Investor is acquiring the Note (or SAFE) for its own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of distributing or selling the same.</p>\n<h2>6. Covenants</h2>\n<p>During the period commencing on the [Effective Date] and continuing until the conversion, repayment, or termination in full of this Note, [Issuer] hereby covenants and agrees with [Investor] as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>(a) Affirmative Covenants.</strong> [Issuer] shall (i) maintain its corporate existence, good standing, and all material licenses and permits necessary for the conduct of its business in all jurisdictions where its failure to do so would have a material adverse effect; (ii) comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations; (iii) keep proper books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, and furnish to [Investor] annual financial statements (audited, if available) within [Number] days after the end of each fiscal year, and unaudited quarterly financial statements within [Number] days after the end of each fiscal quarter; and (iv) use the proceeds from the issuance of this Note solely for general corporate purposes consistent with its business plan and not for any purpose prohibited by law or this Note.</p>\n<p><strong>(b) Negative Covenants.</strong> [Issuer] shall not, without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes (or, if applicable, a majority of the outstanding SAFE agreements by value), directly or indirectly: (i) declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock; (ii) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money other than permitted indebtedness as defined herein or in any other financing agreement; (iii) amend its certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or other organizational documents in a manner that adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Note; (iv) sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets outside the ordinary course of business; (v) merge or consolidate with any other entity, or engage in any reorganization, unless the surviving entity assumes all obligations under the Note; or (vi) create, incur, assume, or suffer to exist any lien upon any of its property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except for Permitted Liens as defined herein.</p>\n<h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>Each party hereto acknowledges that in connection with the negotiation, execution, and performance of this Convertible Note, it may have access to or acquire confidential or proprietary information concerning the business, operations, and financial affairs of the other party. The [Issuer] and the [Investor] (each, a “Receiving Party” when receiving information, and a “Disclosing Party” when disclosing information) agree to keep confidential and not to disclose or use for any purpose other than the performance of their respective obligations under this Convertible Note, any such confidential information, including but not limited to, financial data, business plans, intellectual property, customer lists, and technical information of the Disclosing Party. This obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party; (b) was available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (c) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party, provided that such source is not, to the best of the Receiving Party’s knowledge, bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided that the Receiving Party provides prompt notice to the Disclosing Party to enable it to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The obligations under this Section 7 shall survive the repayment or conversion of this Convertible Note for a period of [X] years from the [Effective Date].</p>\n<h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>The Company represents and warrants to the Investor that it owns or possesses valid licenses or other rights to use all Intellectual Property (including, without limitation, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, and confidential information) that is necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted. All such Intellectual Property is free and clear of any liens, claims, charges, security interests, encumbrances, or other restrictions, except for those of a de minimis nature or as otherwise disclosed in writing to the Investor prior to the Effective Date.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Company represents and warrants that it is not infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the best of the Company's knowledge, no third party is infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property rights owned by the Company. The Company has taken all commercially reasonable steps to protect its proprietary Intellectual Property, including maintaining the confidentiality of its trade secrets and confidential information, and all necessary assignments from employees and contractors of Intellectual Property developed within the scope of their engagement with the Company have been duly executed and are in full force and effect.</p>\n<h2>9. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>The Issuer, [Startup Name], shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Holder, [Investor Name], and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, the cost of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, arising out of or resulting from any breach by the Issuer of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this Convertible Note Agreement, any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuer, or any action or proceeding brought by a third party against an Indemnified Party related to the Issuer's business operations or the issuance of this Note. This indemnification obligation shall survive the repayment, conversion, or termination of this Convertible Note and shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Indemnified Parties may have at law or in equity.</p>\n<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>\n    Except for obligations to repay the Principal Amount and any accrued interest (if applicable) as explicitly set forth in this Convertible Note, neither the Issuer nor the Holder shall be liable to the other party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, revenue, data, or business interruption, arising out of or relating to this Convertible Note, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall limit the Issuer's obligation to convert the Note or repay the Principal Amount and any accrued interest (if applicable) as set forth in this Convertible Note, nor shall it limit liability for damages arising from a party's gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct. The total aggregate liability of either party for any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Convertible Note, other than the specific repayment or conversion obligations hereunder, shall not exceed the Principal Amount of this Convertible Note.\n</p>\n<h2>11. Events of Default (for Convertible Note)</h2>\n<p>The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute an \"Event of Default\" under this Convertible Note:</p>\n<p>(a) **Payment Default:** The [Maker] fails to pay any principal, accrued interest (if any), or other amounts due under this Convertible Note when such amounts become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, or otherwise, and such failure continues for a period of [Number] business days after written notice thereof from the [Holder] to the [Maker].</p>\n<p>(b) **Breach of Covenants:** The [Maker] breaches any material covenant, agreement, or obligation contained in this Convertible Note or any other agreement executed in connection herewith, and such breach, if curable, continues for a period of [Number] business days after written notice thereof from the [Holder] to the [Maker].</p>\n<p>(c) **Insolvency Proceedings:** The [Maker] (i) commences a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law, (ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, (iii) consents to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, or similar official for itself or for any substantial part of its property, (iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (v) generally is not paying its debts as they become due.</p>\n<p>(d) **Involuntary Insolvency Proceedings:** An involuntary case is commenced against the [Maker] under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law, or a receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, or similar official is appointed for the [Maker] or for any substantial part of its property, and such case or appointment is not dismissed or discharged within [Number] days.</p>\n<p>(e) **Misrepresentation:** Any representation or warranty made by the [Maker] in this Convertible Note or any other agreement executed in connection herewith proves to have been materially incorrect or misleading in any respect when made.</p>\n<p>(f) **Dissolution:** The [Maker] takes any action to dissolve or liquidate its business, or any order for its dissolution or liquidation is entered.</p>\n<h2>12. Termination</h2>\n<p>This Convertible Note (the \"Note\") shall terminate, and all obligations of the Company hereunder shall cease, upon the earliest to occur of the following events:</p>\n<p>(a) **Conversion into Equity:** The automatic conversion of the outstanding principal amount of this Note, together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, into Equity Securities of the Company in accordance with the terms set forth in Section [X. Conversion] upon the closing of a Qualified Financing as defined herein. Upon such conversion, this Note shall be deemed cancelled and surrendered, and the Holder shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, other than those rights associated with the Equity Securities received pursuant to such conversion.</p>\n<p>(b) **Repayment in Full:** The full repayment of all outstanding principal and accrued interest under this Note to the Holder, whether at the Maturity Date as defined in Section [Y. Maturity], or upon an Acquisition Event as defined in Section [Z. Acquisition], or otherwise in accordance with the express terms of this Note. Upon such full repayment, this Note shall be deemed cancelled and surrendered, and the Company's obligations shall be fully discharged.</p>\n<p>(c) **Dissolution Event:** The winding up or dissolution of the Company prior to the conversion or repayment of this Note, in which case the rights and obligations of the Holder and the Company shall be governed by the provisions of Section [W. Dissolution] regarding the distribution of assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p>For clarity, this Note is not subject to early termination by the Company prior to the occurrence of one of the events described above, except as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Company and the Holder, and no such termination shall relieve the Company of its obligations to repay or convert the Note as specified herein.</p>\n<h2>13. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Convertible Note Agreement, and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing Jurisdiction], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing Jurisdiction] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of [Governing Jurisdiction].</p>\n<p>The parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in [GoverGoverning Jurisdiction] for any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and agree not to commence any action, suit, or proceeding except in such courts. Each party hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action, suit, or proceeding in any such court and further irrevocably waives any claim that any such action, suit, or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Convertible Note (or SAFE) Agreement, including without limitation the formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between [Issuer Name] and the Holder(s) for a period of not less than thirty (30) days from the date one party provides written notice of the dispute to the other. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation within such thirty (30) day period, then, except as otherwise provided herein, the dispute shall be submitted to and finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Rules Provider, e.g., the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\")] in accordance with its [Specific Arbitration Rules, e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules] then in effect.</p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the aforementioned rules. The seat of the arbitration shall be [Arbitration Location, e.g., San Francisco, California], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties shall bear their own costs and attorneys' fees in connection with the arbitration, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, or for other urgent matters where monetary damages would be an insufficient remedy. Such action shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate any other dispute.</p>\n<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing Law State], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in [Governing Law Jurisdiction, e.g., County of San Francisco, California] for any action seeking injunctive or other equitable relief as permitted above, or for the enforcement of any arbitration award.</p>\n<h2>15. Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>\n<p>\n    This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of [State of Governing Law], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and negotiations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by all parties hereto. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Investor may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, however, that the Investor may assign this Note to an affiliate without the Company's consent. The Company may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Investor. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the parties shall endeavor to replace the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the economic effect of the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision.\n</p>\n<h2>16.

Each signatory represents and warrants that they have the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the entity or individual for whom they are signing, and that their signature constitutes a binding obligation of that entity or individual.

Interest shall commence accruing on the Effective Date and shall continue to accrue on the outstanding Principal Amount until the Note is paid in full or converted in accordance with its terms.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">1. Definitions</h2>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">As used in this Note, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:</p>\n\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">\"<b>Conversion Event</b>\" means a Qualified Financing or a Change of Control, as defined herein, or the Maturity Date.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">\"<b>Discount Rate</b>\" means [Z]%. This percentage shall be applied to the price per share of the Conversion Shares issued in a Qualified Financing, effectively allowing the Holder to convert at a reduced price compared to new investors in such financing. The application of this discount is intended to compensate the Holder for the early investment risk taken.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">\"<b>Maturity Date</b>\" means [Date], or such earlier date as the Note becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Upon the Maturity Date, if the Note has not previously been converted or repaid, the outstanding Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest shall become immediately due and payable, subject to the Issuer's option to convert as specified in Section 3.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">\"<b>Qualified Financing</b>\" means the next bona fide equity financing round of the Issuer in which the Issuer issues and sells its equity securities for aggregate gross proceeds of at least [$B] (excluding the conversion of this Note and other convertible securities) to one or more third-party investors. This threshold ensures that the financing event is substantial enough to warrant a conversion of the Note into equity, reflecting a significant valuation milestone for the Issuer.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">\"<b>Valuation Cap</b>\" means [$A]. This cap sets a maximum pre-money valuation at which the Note will convert into equity in a Qualified Financing, regardless of the actual valuation achieved in that financing. The Valuation Cap provides the Holder with downside protection and ensures a minimum ownership percentage in the event of a highly successful financing round at a much higher valuation.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">2. Payment Terms</h2>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable upon the earliest of (a) the Maturity Date, (b) the occurrence of a Qualified Financing, or (c) a Change of Control, unless earlier converted or repaid as provided herein. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The Issuer acknowledges its primary obligation to repay this Note in full, including all accrued interest, unless a conversion event occurs. The Holder is not obligated to accept any form of payment other than cash unless explicitly agreed upon in writing or mandated by a conversion event as detailed in this Note. This ensures clarity on the Issuer's financial commitment and the Holder's right to repayment.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">3. Maturity</h2>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Unless earlier converted or repaid in accordance with the terms of this Note, the entire outstanding Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest shall become due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Issuer shall provide written notice to the Holder at least thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date, informing the Holder of the impending maturity and the total amount due.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Upon the Maturity Date, the Issuer shall have the option, exercisable in its sole discretion, to convert the outstanding Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest into shares of the Issuer’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the Valuation Cap divided by the fully diluted capitalization of the Issuer immediately prior to such conversion. This option provides the Issuer with flexibility in managing its financial obligations, potentially avoiding a cash repayment if a Qualified Financing has not occurred.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">4. Conversion</h2>\n\n        <h3>4.1. Conversion Upon Qualified Financing</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Upon the closing of a Qualified Financing, the entire outstanding Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest under this Note shall automatically convert into shares of the same class and series of equity securities issued to investors in such Qualified Financing (the \"<b>Conversion Shares</b>\"). The conversion price per share shall be the lower of (a) the price per share paid by the new investors in the Qualified Financing multiplied by the Discount Rate, or (b) the price per share calculated by dividing the Valuation Cap by the Issuer’s fully diluted capitalization immediately prior to the Qualified Financing.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The Issuer shall provide the Holder with written notice of a Qualified Financing at least ten (10) business days prior to its anticipated closing, specifying the terms of the financing and the calculation of the conversion price. Upon conversion, the Holder shall be issued a certificate or equivalent electronic record representing the Conversion Shares, and this Note shall be deemed cancelled. No fractional shares shall be issued; any fractional shares shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share, and the Issuer shall pay the Holder cash for such fractional share based on the conversion price.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>4.2. Conversion Upon Change of Control</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">In the event of a Change of Control prior to the conversion of this Note pursuant to a Qualified Financing or the Maturity Date, the Holder shall have the option, exercisable by written notice to the Issuer, to either (a) convert the outstanding Principal Amount and all accrued and unpaid interest into shares of common stock of the Issuer at a conversion price equal to the Valuation Cap divided by the fully diluted capitalization of the Issuer immediately prior to the Change of Control, or (b) require the Issuer to pay to the Holder, concurrently with the closing of such Change of Control, an amount equal to [1.5x to 2x] times the outstanding Principal Amount plus all accrued and unpaid interest.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">A \"Change of Control\" shall mean (i) a consolidation or merger of the Issuer with or into any other corporation or entity, or (ii) any transaction or series of related transactions in which the Issuer’s stockholders immediately prior to such transaction own less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such transaction, or (iii) the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer. The Issuer shall provide prompt written notice to the Holder of any proposed Change of Control, including all material terms thereof, allowing the Holder sufficient time to exercise its option.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">5. Representations and Warranties of Issuer</h2>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The Issuer hereby represents and warrants to the Holder that: (a) the Issuer is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of [State], and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted; (b) the execution, delivery, and performance of this Note have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Issuer; and (c) this Note constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Furthermore, the Issuer represents that there are no outstanding agreements, options, warrants, or other rights or commitments obligating the Issuer to issue any capital stock or other equity interests, except as disclosed to the Holder in writing. The Issuer also warrants that it is not in violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, and that there are no legal actions, suits, or proceedings pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against the Issuer that would materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Note.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">6. Covenants of Issuer</h2>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Until this Note is fully repaid or converted, the Issuer covenants and agrees to: (a) maintain its corporate existence in good standing and comply with all applicable laws and regulations; (b) provide the Holder with copies of its annual audited financial statements and quarterly unaudited financial statements within a reasonable time after their preparation; and (c) provide the Holder with reasonable access to its books and records upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, provided such access does not unreasonably interfere with the Issuer’s operations.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The Issuer further covenants that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the Holder, (i) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money ranking senior to or <i>pari passu</i> with this Note, (ii) declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions on its capital stock, or (iii) enter into any transaction that would constitute a Change of Control without providing the Holder the rights set forth in Section 4.2. These covenants are designed to protect the Holder's investment and ensure the Issuer's financial stability and transparency.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">7. Events of Default</h2>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an \"<b>Event of Default</b>\" under this Note: (a) the Issuer fails to pay any principal or interest when due under this Note and such failure continues for five (5) business days after written notice from the Holder; (b) the Issuer breaches any material covenant or agreement contained in this Note, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice from the Holder; (c) the Issuer makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver, trustee, or liquidator is appointed for the Issuer or any substantial part of its property; or (d) the Issuer files a petition in bankruptcy or is adjudicated insolvent or bankrupt.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Holder, at its option, may declare the entire outstanding Principal Amount of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest, or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Issuer. The Holder shall also have all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity, including the right to enforce this Note through legal proceedings. The Holder's failure to exercise any right or remedy upon an Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">8. Miscellaneous</h2>\n\n        <h3>8.1. Governing Law</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [State], without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. This choice of law ensures consistency and predictability in the interpretation and enforcement of the Note's terms, providing a clear legal framework for all parties involved.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The parties acknowledge and agree that the courts located in [County, State] shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Note. By executing this Note, the Issuer and Holder irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such action or proceeding and waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.2. Dispute Resolution</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Note, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Association, e.g., JAMS] in accordance with its then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in [City, State], and the language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the request for arbitration, the arbitrator shall be appointed by [Arbitration Association]. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The prevailing party in any arbitration or litigation arising hereunder shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.3. Assignment</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Neither this Note nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by the Issuer without the prior written consent of the Holder. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be null and void and of no force or effect. This restriction is intended to ensure that the Issuer's obligations remain with the original entity and are not transferred to an unknown or financially unstable third party without the Holder's explicit approval.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The Holder may assign or transfer this Note, in whole or in part, to any person or entity, provided that the Holder provides prompt written notice of such assignment to the Issuer. Upon any such permitted assignment, the assignee shall succeed to all the rights and obligations of the Holder hereunder. This flexibility for the Holder allows for liquidity and transferability of the investment, which can be crucial for early-stage investors.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.4. Notices</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) on the date sent by email (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient; or (d) on the third day after the date mailed, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Notices must be sent to the respective parties at the addresses set forth at the beginning of this Note (or to such other address or email address as may be designated by a party from time to time in accordance with this Section). This detailed notice provision ensures that all formal communications are delivered and acknowledged effectively, minimizing disputes over whether a party received important information.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.5. Entire Agreement</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">This Note constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. This clause is critical for ensuring that all prior discussions or informal agreements are superseded by the formal, written terms of this Note, thereby preventing future disputes based on unwritten understandings.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">No oral statements or representations made by any party shall be binding or enforceable unless expressly incorporated into this Note. The parties acknowledge that they have not relied on any statement, representation, or warranty other than those expressly set forth in this Note. This reinforces the principle that the written document is the complete and final expression of their agreement.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.6. Amendments</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">This Note may only be amended, modified, or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by both the Issuer and the Holder. No waiver of any provision of this Note shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is asserted. A waiver of any default shall not be a waiver of any subsequent default.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">The requirement for written amendments ensures that any changes to the terms of the Note are formally documented and agreed upon by all parties, preventing informal or disputed alterations. This also applies to waivers, ensuring that a party's forbearance in one instance does not prejudice its rights in future instances of non-compliance.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.7. Severability</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">If any term or provision of this Note is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Note or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. This clause ensures that the remainder of the Note remains in full force and effect even if a specific part is found to be legally problematic.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Note so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. This commitment to renegotiate demonstrates the parties' intent to uphold the spirit of the agreement despite unforeseen legal challenges.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h3>8.8. Counterparts</h3>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">This Note may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Note delivered by facsimile, email, or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Note.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:6.0pt;\">This provision facilitates the execution of the Note when parties are not in the same physical location, allowing for efficient and legally binding agreement through electronic means. It ensures that all separately signed copies collectively form a single, enforceable contract.</p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n        <h2 style=\"margin-top:18.0pt;\">9.

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them below:</p>\n<p><b>\"Company\"</b> means [Company Name], a [State of Incorporation] corporation, with its principal place of business located at [Company Address], and its successors and assigns.</p>\n<p><b>\"Assignor\"</b> means [Assignor Name], an individual residing at [Assignor Address], or a legal entity with its principal place of business at [Assignor Address], who is either an employee or independent contractor of the Company, and their heirs, executors, administrators, and permitted assigns.</p>\n<p><b>\"Intellectual Property\"</b> or <b>\"IP\"</b> means any and all inventions, discoveries, designs, developments, improvements, trade secrets, know-how, works of authorship, copyrights, mask works, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, patents, patent applications, and all other proprietary rights, whether or not patentable or registrable, and whether or not reduced to practice, and all applications, registrations, renewals, reissues, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, and extensions thereof, throughout the world.</p>\n<p><b>\"Assigned IP\"</b> means all Intellectual Property, including but not limited to \"Work Product\" (as defined below), that the Assignor conceived, developed, created, or reduced to practice, either solely or jointly with others, during the period of their employment or engagement with the Company, regardless of whether such IP was created during working hours or using Company resources, and which relates to the Company's actual or anticipated business, research, or development.</p>\n<p><b>\"Work Product\"</b> means all tangible and intangible results, deliverables, materials, and documentation, including but not limited to software, code, designs, specifications, reports, data, analyses, prototypes, models, drawings, and other works of authorship, generated by the Assignor in the course of performing services for the Company, or which relate to the Company's business.</p>\n<p><b>\"Effective Date\"</b> means the date first written above or [Effective Date], upon which this Agreement becomes legally binding and effective between the Company and the Assignor.</p>\n<h2>2. Effective Date and Parties</h2>\n<p>This Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into and effective as of [Effective Date] (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between [Assignor's Full Legal Name], an individual residing at [Assignor's Address] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Assignor\"), and [Assignee's Full Legal Name], a [State of Incorporation/Registration] corporation/limited liability company/entity, duly organized and existing under the laws of [State of Incorporation/Registration], with its principal place of business located at [Assignee's Address] (hereinafter referred to as the \"Assignee\"). The Assignor and Assignee may hereinafter be referred to individually as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\" This Agreement legally binds the Parties from the Effective Date, governing the comprehensive assignment of intellectual property rights as detailed in the subsequent sections.</p>\n<h2>3. Assignment of Intellectual Property</h2>\n<p>\n    [Assignor] (the \"Assignor\") hereby irrevocably and perpetually assigns, transfers, and conveys to [Company Name] (the \"Company\"), its successors and assigns, all worldwide right, title, and interest in and to any and all inventions, discoveries, improvements, designs, works of authorship, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, copyrightable works, trade secrets, know-how, moral rights (to the maximum extent assignable), and all other intellectual property rights (collectively, \"Intellectual Property\") that have been or are hereafter conceived, created, developed, reduced to practice, or otherwise made or acquired by the Assignor, either alone or jointly with others, during the period of the Assignor's employment or engagement with the Company, whether or not during working hours or using Company facilities, and which relate to the Company's actual or anticipated business, research, or development, or which result from or are suggested by any work performed by the Assignor for the Company. This assignment includes, without limitation, all rights to sue for past, present, and future infringements.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Assignor further agrees that all such Intellectual Property shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and the Assignor shall have no rights, title, or interest therein. The Assignor acknowledges that this assignment is made for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, including but not limited to the Assignor's employment or engagement with the Company and the compensation received or to be received therefrom.\n</p>\n<h2>4. Consideration</h2>\n<p>In consideration of [Employee/Contractor Name]'s employment or engagement as a contractor by [Company Name], including the salary, wages, benefits, access to confidential information, company resources, and other valuable compensation received or to be received by [Employee/Contractor Name] from [Company Name] during the period of employment or engagement, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by [Employee/Contractor Name], and in further consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, [Employee/Contractor Name] agrees to the assignment of all Intellectual Property (as defined herein) created, conceived, reduced to practice, or developed by [Employee/Contractor Name] within the scope of their employment or engagement with [Company Name]. This consideration is deemed full, adequate, and complete for the assignment of all rights, title, and interest in and to such Intellectual Property to [Company Name] as set forth in this Agreement, effective as of [Effective Date]. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement does not create any additional compensation obligations beyond those already established or agreed upon in [Employee/Contractor Name]'s employment agreement or contractor agreement with [Company Name], unless explicitly stated otherwise in a separate, written agreement executed by both parties subsequent to the date hereof.</p>\n<h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>\n    The [Assignor] acknowledges that in the course of their engagement with the [Company], they have had and will continue to have access to confidential and proprietary information belonging to the [Company], including but not limited to trade secrets, business plans, financial data, customer lists, technical data, product designs, software code, marketing strategies, and any information related to the development, research, or commercialization of the Assigned IP (collectively, \"Confidential Information\").\n</p>\n<p>\n    The [Assignor] agrees to maintain the strictest confidence regarding all Confidential Information, both during and after the term of their engagement with the [Company]. The [Assignor] shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, disseminate, publish, or use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the sole benefit of the [Company] in the performance of their duties, nor shall they permit any third party to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This confidentiality obligation shall not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the [Assignor]; (b) was rightfully in the [Assignor]'s possession prior to disclosure by the [Company]; (c) is independently developed by the [Assignor] without use of or reference to the [Company]'s Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, provided that the [Assignor] gives prompt written notice to the [Company] of such requirement and cooperates with the [Company] in any effort to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Upon termination of the [Assignor]'s engagement with the [Company] for any reason, or at any time upon the [Company]'s request, the [Assignor] shall immediately return to the [Company] all documents, records, data, notes, prototypes, equipment, and any other tangible or intangible property, including all copies thereof, containing or embodying Confidential Information or Assigned IP.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Representations and Warranties</h2>\n<p>\n    [Assignor Name] hereby represents and warrants to [Company Name] as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n    (a) <strong>Sole Ownership and Originality.</strong> [Assignor Name] is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the Intellectual Property (as defined herein, including all Assigned IP), and all such Intellectual Property is original to [Assignor Name] and was created solely by [Assignor Name] during the course of [his/her/their] employment or engagement with [Company Name].\n</p>\n<p>\n    (b) <strong>No Encumbrances or Infringement.</strong> The Intellectual Property is free and clear of any liens, encumbrances, security interests, or other third-party claims or rights. The use, development, and exploitation of the Intellectual Property by [Company Name] as contemplated by this Agreement will not infringe upon or misappropriate the intellectual property rights or any other proprietary rights of any third party.\n</p>\n<p>\n    (c) <strong>Right to Assign.</strong> [Assignor Name] has the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to assign all rights, title, and interest in and to the Intellectual Property to [Company Name] as provided herein, without the consent of any other person or entity.\n</p>\n<p>\n    (d) <strong>No Prior Assignments.</strong> [Assignor Name] has not previously assigned, transferred, licensed, or otherwise encumbered any rights in the Intellectual Property to any third party, nor is [Assignor Name] under any obligation or restriction that would prevent or limit the full assignment of the Intellectual Property to [Company Name] as contemplated by this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n    (e) <strong>No Conflicting Agreements.</strong> [Assignor Name] is not a party to any agreement, contract, or understanding that would conflict with or be violated by the terms of this Agreement or the assignment of the Intellectual Property contemplated herein.\n</p>\n<p>\n    (f) <strong>Full Disclosure.</strong> [Assignor Name] has disclosed to [Company Name] all information known to [Assignor Name] regarding the Intellectual Property that is material to [Company Name]'s ownership or use of the Intellectual Property.\n</p>\n<h2>7. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>[Assignor] shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless [Assignee], its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) arising out of or in connection with: (a) any breach by [Assignor] of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this [Agreement]; (b) any claim that the [Assigned IP Rights], as created by [Assignor] and assigned hereunder, infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of any third party existing prior to or at the time of assignment; or (c) any claim that [Assignor] did not have the full right, power, and authority to assign the [Assigned IP Rights] to [Assignee] as contemplated herein. [Assignee] shall provide [Assignor] with prompt written notice of any such claim and shall cooperate with [Assignor], at [Assignor]'s expense, in the defense of such claim. [Assignor] shall have sole control over the defense and settlement of any such claim, provided that [Assignor] shall not settle any claim in a manner that imposes any obligation or liability on [Assignee] without [Assignee]'s prior written consent. This indemnification obligation shall not apply to any claim arising from modifications made by [Assignee] to the [Assigned IP Rights] or from the use of the [Assigned IP Rights] by [Assignee] in a manner not contemplated by this [Agreement] or applicable law.</p>\n<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [Governing Law State], United States of America, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Governing Law State] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of [Governing Law State]. The Parties irrevocably agree that the federal and state courts located in [Governing Jurisdiction] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding. This choice of law and jurisdiction is intended to be a comprehensive and exclusive selection of the governing law and forum for any and all disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to, matters concerning the validity, interpretation, performance, or breach of this Agreement, and any intellectual property rights transferred hereunder.</p>\n<h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be attempted to be resolved through good-faith negotiation between [Party A] and [Party B]. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of the first written notice of the dispute, then the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the [Arbitration Rules, e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association] of the [Arbitration Body] by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or failing agreement within ten (10) days, appointed by the [Arbitration Body]. The seat of arbitration shall be [Arbitration Location], and the language of the arbitration shall be English. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both Parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees, shall be borne equally by the Parties, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall prevent either Party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction located in [Governing Law State], [Governing Law Country] to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its intellectual property rights or to enforce the terms of this Agreement where monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy.</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

During the course of this Engagement, Assignor has developed, conceived, or reduced to practice certain intellectual property, including but not limited to inventions, works of authorship, and proprietary information, which are directly related to the scope of the Engagement and Assignee's business.</p>\n        <p>WHEREAS, it is a fundamental condition of the Engagement that all intellectual property created or developed by Assignor in the course of or arising out of the Engagement shall be the sole and exclusive property of Assignee. Assignor desires to irrevocably assign, and Assignee desires to irrevocably accept, all rights, title, and interest in and to such intellectual property, including all associated proprietary rights, to Assignee as set forth herein, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and the compensation or other benefits provided under the Engagement.</p>\n\n        <h2>1. DEFINITIONS</h2>\n        <p><strong>1.1. \"Intellectual Property\" or \"IP\"</strong> means any and all inventions, discoveries, designs, methods, processes, formulae, works of authorship, software, algorithms, data, databases, mask works, trademarks, trade names, service marks, trade dress, logos, slogans, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, moral rights, and all other intellectual property rights, whether or not patentable or registrable, and whether existing now or hereafter arising, including all applications, registrations, renewals, extensions, continuations, divisions, reissues, and re-examinations thereof, throughout the world.</p>\n        <p>This definition explicitly includes all rights of publicity, personality rights, and any similar rights, and all physical embodiments thereof, relating to or arising from the Work Product. It is understood that \"Intellectual Property\" encompasses all forms of intangible assets that are legally protectable and are created, conceived, or reduced to practice by Assignor in connection with the Engagement, regardless of whether such creation occurred during working hours or using Assignee's equipment, unless specifically excluded by applicable law.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>1.2. \"Work Product\"</strong> means any and all Intellectual Property, materials, documents, discoveries, inventions, improvements, designs, works of authorship, computer programs, processes, methods, data, analyses, reports, specifications, and other deliverables or creations, whether patentable or unpatentable, copyrightable or uncopyrightable, that are made, conceived, reduced to practice, or developed by Assignor, either individually or jointly with others, during the term of the Engagement and that (a) relate to Assignee's actual or anticipated business, research, or development; (b) result from any work performed by Assignor for Assignee; or (c) are developed using Assignee's equipment, supplies, facilities, or confidential information.</p>\n        <p>The term \"Work Product\" is to be interpreted broadly to ensure that Assignee obtains full ownership of all intellectual output generated by Assignor in the context of their relationship, including any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works based on Assignee's existing Intellectual Property or arising directly from Assignor's assigned duties. This includes all forms of tangible or intangible expression, regardless of the medium in which they are recorded or stored.</p>\n\n        <h2>2. ASSIGNMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>\n        <p>Assignor hereby irrevocably and absolutely assigns, transfers, and conveys to Assignee, and its successors and assigns, all of Assignor's worldwide right, title, and interest in and to all Work Product, including all Intellectual Property rights therein, whether now existing or hereafter created, without further consideration, effective immediately upon the creation or conception of such Work Product. This assignment is perpetual and extends to all territories and jurisdictions globally, ensuring Assignee's complete and unencumbered ownership of the Work Product and all associated rights.</p>\n        <p>This assignment includes, but is not limited to, all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, and all other proprietary rights of any kind or nature whatsoever, including all moral rights to the maximum extent permitted by law. To the extent that any moral rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, Assignor hereby waives and agrees never to assert such moral rights against Assignee or its successors, licensees, or assigns. Assignee shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all Work Product and shall have the exclusive right to obtain, hold, and renew, in its own name, all patents, copyrights, registrations, and other protections and proprietary rights that may be available for the Work Product.</p>\n\n        <h2>3. FURTHER ASSURANCES</h2>\n        <p>Assignor agrees to execute and deliver any and all documents, including applications for patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property registrations, and to take any other actions that Assignee may reasonably request, at Assignee's expense, to perfect, register, confirm, or defend Assignee's sole and exclusive right, title, and interest in and to the Work Product and the Intellectual Property assigned hereunder. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, providing testimony in any legal proceeding, assisting in the prosecution of any intellectual property applications, and signing all necessary assignments or other instruments.</p>\n        <p>Assignor's obligations under this Section 3 shall survive the termination or expiration of the Engagement and this Agreement for any reason whatsoever. Should Assignee be unable to secure Assignor's signature on any document necessary to apply for, prosecute, obtain, or enforce any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right relating to the Work Product for any reason whatsoever, Assignor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Assignee and its duly authorized officers and agents as Assignor's agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on Assignor's behalf to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution, issuance, and enforcement of such intellectual property rights with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Assignor.</p>\n\n        <h2>4. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\n        <p>Assignor acknowledges that during the Engagement, Assignor may have access to and become acquainted with confidential and proprietary information belonging to Assignee, including but not limited to trade secrets, business plans, financial data, customer lists, technical data, product designs, marketing strategies, and other non-public information (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"). Assignor agrees to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and not to disclose, use, or exploit such information for any purpose other than for the benefit of Assignee during the Engagement, or as required by law.</p>\n        <p>Assignor further agrees that the obligation of confidentiality shall survive the termination of the Engagement and this Agreement indefinitely. Assignor shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of Assignee. This obligation does not apply to information that (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of Assignor; (b) was known to Assignor prior to the Engagement without restriction; or (c) is required to be disclosed by law, provided Assignor gives Assignee prompt written notice of such requirement and cooperates with Assignee in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy.</p>\n\n        <h2>5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h2>\n        <p>Assignor represents and warrants to Assignee that: (a) Assignor is the sole author and creator of the Work Product and has not assigned, transferred, or encumbered any rights in the Work Product to any third party prior to the Effective Date; (b) Assignor has the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to assign the Work Product and Intellectual Property rights hereunder without the consent of any other person or entity; (c) the Work Product is original and does not infringe upon, misappropriate, or violate any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights of any third party; and (d) Assignor has not incorporated into the Work Product any materials from any third party without the express written consent of Assignee and the third party, or any materials that would require Assignee to license or make public any of its Intellectual Property.</p>\n        <p>Assignor further represents and warrants that there are no existing or threatened claims, demands, or litigation that would in any way impair Assignee's full enjoyment of the rights assigned hereunder. Assignor has not entered into any agreements, whether written or oral, that would conflict with the provisions of this Agreement or that would prevent Assignor from performing its obligations hereunder. Assignor will promptly notify Assignee if Assignor becomes aware of any actual or potential claim or infringement related to the Work Product or the rights assigned herein.</p>\n\n        <h2>6. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>\n        <p>Assignor agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Assignee, its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with: (a) any breach by Assignor of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement; (b) any claim that the Work Product or Assignee's use thereof infringes upon, misappropriates, or violates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party, to the extent such infringement, misappropriation, or violation arises from Assignor's actions or omissions; or (c) any claim arising from Assignor's gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of the Engagement.</p>\n        <p>Assignee shall provide Assignor with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought. Assignor shall have the right to assume the defense of any such claim with counsel of its own choosing, subject to Assignee's reasonable approval, provided that Assignor acknowledges its obligation to indemnify Assignee. Assignee shall cooperate fully with Assignor in the defense of any such claim, at Assignor's expense. Assignor shall not settle any claim without Assignee's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, if such settlement would impose any obligation or liability on Assignee or prejudice Assignee's rights.</p>\n\n        <h2>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>\n        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL ASSIGNEE BE LIABLE TO ASSIGNOR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF ASSIGNEE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ENGAGEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.</p>\n        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, ASSIGNEE'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO ASSIGNOR FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL COMPENSATION PAID BY ASSIGNEE TO ASSIGNOR UNDER THE ENGAGEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE.</p>\n\n        <h2>8. GOVERNING LAW</h2>\n        <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of [State of Governing Law], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.</p>\n        <p>The parties acknowledge that this choice of law is a material term of this Agreement and that the laws of the chosen jurisdiction are sufficient to protect the rights and obligations of both parties. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [County, State of Governing Law], and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.</p>\n\n        <h2>9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>\n        <p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach, termination, or validity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiations between the parties for a period of at least thirty (30) days from the date one party notifies the other of a dispute. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n        <p>The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA rules, and the arbitration shall take place in [County, State of Governing Law]. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees and reasonable attorneys' fees of the prevailing party, shall be borne by the non-prevailing party as determined by the arbitrator. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its Intellectual Property rights or Confidential Information.</p>\n\n        <h2>10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h2>\n        <p><strong>10.1. Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Assignor and Assignee with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, between the parties relating to such subject matter. There are no promises, conditions, understandings, inducements, representations, or warranties, express or implied, oral or written, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein.</p>\n        <p>Assignor acknowledges that it has not relied upon any representation or statement made by Assignee or its representatives not set forth in this Agreement. Any terms or conditions in any purchase order, invoice, or other document issued by either party that are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms of this Agreement shall be null and void and of no force or effect.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>10.2. Amendments.</strong> No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both Assignor and Assignee. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereof.</p>\n        <p>The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to in writing by the party alleged to have waived the right or provision. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>10.3. Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, or, if such modification is not possible, the provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.</p>\n        <p>The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest extent possible, the original commercial intent of the invalid or unenforceable provision. This clause is intended to ensure the maximum enforceability of this Agreement's terms.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>10.4. Successors and Assigns.</strong> This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.

The rights and obligations of Assignee under this Agreement shall be freely assignable and transferable, and all covenants, agreements, and undertakings of Assignor herein shall be for the benefit of Assignee's successors and assigns.</p>\n\n        <p style=\"margin-top: 0.3in;\">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement as of the Effective Date first written above.</p>\n\n        <table style=\"width: 100%; margin-top: 0.5in;\">\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-right: 0.2in;\">\n                    <p><strong>ASSIGNOR:</strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-top: 0.4in;\"><span class=\"signature-line\"></span></p>\n                    <p class=\"signature-label\">Name: [Assignor Name]</p>\n                    <p class=\"signature-label\">Date: [Date]</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%; padding-left: 0.2in;\">\n                    <p><strong>ASSIGNEE:</strong></p>\n                    <p style=\"margin-top: 0.4in;\"><span class=\"signature-line\"></span></p>\n                    <p class=\"signature-label\">By: [Authorized Signatory Name]</p>\n                    <p class=\"signature-label\">Title: [Authorized Signatory Title]</p>\n                    <p class=\"signature-label\">Company: [Assignee Company Name]</p>\n                    <p class=\"signature-label\">Date: [Date]</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

This Agreement grants [Licensee] a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, and does not convey any ownership interest in or to the Software or any intellectual property rights of [Licensor].\n</p>\n<p>\n    [Licensee] acknowledges and agrees that the Software, in its source code, object code, and all related materials, constitutes valuable proprietary information and trade secrets of [Licensor]. [Licensee] shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software; (b) create derivative works based on the Software; (c) remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices from the Software or its documentation; (d) use the Software for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or (e) publish, disclose, or make available to any third party any confidential information or trade secrets relating to the Software without the prior written consent of [Licensor].\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the event that [Licensee] provides any feedback, suggestions, or ideas regarding the Software (\"Feedback\"), [Licensee] hereby grants [Licensor] a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such Feedback in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, and to incorporate such Feedback into the Software or other products or services of [Licensor] without any obligation or compensation to [Licensee].\n</p>\n<h2>5. Warranties</h2>\n<p>[Licensor] warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the Effective Date, the [Software], when used in accordance with the accompanying documentation, will perform substantially in conformance with its specifications. [Licensor] does not warrant that the [Software] will operate uninterrupted or error-free, or that all errors will be corrected. This limited warranty does not apply to problems caused by (a) modifications made to the [Software] by anyone other than [Licensor]; (b) use of the [Software] in a manner inconsistent with the documentation; (c) use of the [Software] with equipment or software not supplied or approved by [Licensor]; or (d) any other cause external to the [Software].</p>\n<p>EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE [SOFTWARE] IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND [LICENSOR] HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY [LICENSOR] OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.</p>\n<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall [Licensor] or its suppliers be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, loss of data, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use the [Software], even if [Licensor] has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, [Licensor]'s total aggregate liability to [Licensee] for any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the [Software], whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall in no event exceed the greater of (a) the fees actually paid by [Licensee] to [Licensor] for the [Software] license during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) [Specific Dollar Amount, e.g., $1,000.00]. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to damages arising from [Licensor]'s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this Section 6 are a fundamental part of the basis of the bargain between [Licensor] and [Licensee], and reflect a fair allocation of risk between them. Without these limitations, [Licensor] would not be able to offer the [Software] on the terms provided in this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>7. Termination</h2>\n<p>7.1. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party if the other Party commits a material breach of any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within [Number, e.g., thirty (30)] days after receiving written notice thereof. Such notice must specify the nature of the breach in reasonable detail.</p>\n<p>7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, [Licensor Name] may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to [Licensee Name] if [Licensee Name] breaches any of the provisions regarding intellectual property rights, scope of license, usage restrictions, or confidentiality as set forth in Sections [e.g., 3, 4, and 5] of this Agreement. Furthermore, [Licensor Name] may terminate this Agreement immediately if [Licensee Name] becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or ceases to conduct business in the ordinary course.</p>\n<p>7.3. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, [Licensee Name]'s license to use the [Software Name] shall immediately cease, and [Licensee Name] shall promptly cease all use of the [Software Name] and destroy or return to [Licensor Name] all copies of the [Software Name] and all related documentation in its possession or control, certifying such destruction or return in writing within [Number, e.g., ten (10)] days of termination. All outstanding payment obligations accrued prior to the effective date of termination shall remain due and payable.</p>\n<p>7.4.

Sections [e.g., 1 (Definitions), 6 (Intellectual Property Rights), 8 (Confidentiality), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 10 (Indemnification), 11 (Governing Law), and 12 (Miscellaneous)], along with any other provisions which by their nature are intended to survive termination, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Software License Agreement and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the [Governing Jurisdiction], without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the [Governing Jurisdiction] or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the [Governing Jurisdiction]. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of [Governing Jurisdiction] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation. This choice of law and jurisdiction is intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the law and forum governing all aspects of the relationship between the parties relating to this Agreement.

Definitions</h2>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Confidential Information\"</b> means any non-public information, whether commercial, financial, technical, or otherwise, disclosed by one party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other party (the \"Receiving Party\"), whether orally, in writing, or by any other means, that is designated as confidential or that, by its nature, would reasonably be understood to be confidential. This includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, business plans, product roadmaps, customer lists, pricing information, and technical specifications of the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Documentation\"</b> means all user manuals, technical manuals, release notes, and other materials, whether in print or electronic form, that describe the installation, operation, and use of the Software. This definition encompasses any updates, supplements, or revisions to such materials provided by Licensor to Licensee during the term of this Agreement, which are intended to facilitate the proper and effective utilization of the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"License\"</b> means the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited right granted by Licensor to Licensee to install and use the Software and Documentation strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. This License explicitly excludes any right to sublicense, distribute, or otherwise make the Software available to third parties, or to use it for purposes beyond Licensee's internal business operations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Software\"</b> means the proprietary software identified as \"[SOFTWARE NAME]\", including all modules, components, features, updates, upgrades, enhancements, modifications, and related documentation provided by Licensor. This definition encompasses both the object code and, where expressly provided in writing by Licensor, any source code, along with all associated intellectual property rights, regardless of the medium or form.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Usage Limits\"</b> means specific restrictions on the use of the Software, which may include, but are not limited to, the maximum number of authorized users, concurrent users, installations, processing capacity, data storage, or transactional volume, as detailed in Appendix A attached hereto or the applicable order form. These limits are fundamental to the scope of the granted License and any exceeding thereof constitutes a material breach.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>2. Grant of License</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable (under specific conditions outlined in Section 11), limited license to install and use the object code version of the Software and the accompanying Documentation solely for Licensee's internal business operations. This license is strictly limited by the Usage Limits specified in Appendix A and does not include any right to sublicense, distribute, or otherwise make the Software available to third parties, nor does it grant any rights to the Software's source code unless explicitly agreed upon in a separate written addendum.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Licensee is expressly prohibited from using the Software for any purposes other than those explicitly permitted herein, including but not limited to, providing service bureau services, commercial hosting, or any other commercial exploitation of the Software for the benefit of third parties. Any use beyond the defined Usage Limits or for unauthorized purposes shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate termination of the license, in addition to Licensor pursuing all available legal and equitable remedies for damages incurred.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>3. Usage Limits and Restrictions</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensee's use of the Software is strictly limited to [SPECIFY LIMITS, e.g., a maximum of X concurrent users, Y installations on designated servers, Z transactions per month], as further detailed in Appendix A. Licensee shall not exceed these specified limits without obtaining a separate written agreement and, if applicable, paying additional fees to Licensor. Licensee agrees to implement reasonable technical measures and internal policies to monitor and enforce these usage limits, and shall provide periodic reports to Licensor upon request demonstrating compliance.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Software or Documentation; (b) rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, or otherwise transfer rights in the Software or Documentation; (c) remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on the Software or Documentation; (d) use the Software to develop any competing product or service; or (e) use the Software in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation, including but not limited to data privacy laws.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>4. Term</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of [NUMBER] years (the \"Initial Term\"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive [NUMBER] year periods (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal to the other party at least [NUMBER] days prior to the end of the then-current term. Such notice of non-renewal must be clear and unambiguous.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Licensee's right to use the Software is strictly contingent upon the continuous effectiveness of this Agreement. In the event of termination or expiration, Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software and Documentation, and shall, within [NUMBER] days, certify in writing to Licensor that all copies of the Software and Documentation, including any backup or archival copies, have been permanently deleted from its systems and destroyed. Failure to provide such certification within the stipulated timeframe shall be considered a material breach.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall pay Licensor the license fees as set forth in Appendix B or the applicable order form executed by both parties. All fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, such as in the case of a material uncured breach by Licensor. Payments shall be due within [NUMBER] days of the invoice date, and all invoices shall clearly detail the services rendered and the corresponding fees.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the event of late payment, Licensor reserves the right to charge interest on overdue amounts at the rate of [PERCENTAGE]% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, calculated from the due date until the date of full payment. Licensor may also suspend Licensee's access to the Software or terminate this Agreement for material breach if payments remain outstanding for more than [NUMBER] days after Licensee receives written notice of delinquency from Licensor.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>\n        <p>\n            Each party acknowledges that during the term of this Agreement, it may have access to Confidential Information of the other party. Each party agrees to maintain the strictest confidentiality of all such Confidential Information and to use it solely for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. Neither party shall disclose, reproduce, or transmit any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, and shall implement reasonable security measures to protect such information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of [NUMBER] years, or indefinitely for trade secrets. These obligations do not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written records; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the Disclosing Party to allow for protective measures.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to the Software and Documentation, including all associated intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights), are and shall remain exclusively with Licensor or its licensors. This Agreement grants only a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Software and does not convey any ownership interest or rights in the Software or Documentation to Licensee, nor does it imply any transfer of intellectual property.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall not challenge or assist any third party in challenging Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Software or Documentation, nor shall it register or attempt to register any intellectual property rights that are confusingly similar to those of Licensor. Any feedback, suggestions, or improvements provided by Licensee regarding the Software shall be deemed the sole property of Licensor, and Licensor shall be free to use, incorporate, and exploit such feedback without any obligation, restriction, or compensation to Licensee.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8. Warranties</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor warrants that for a period of [NUMBER] days from the Effective Date (the \"Warranty Period\"), the Software will substantially conform to the specifications set forth in the Documentation when used in accordance with this Agreement. Licensor does not warrant that the Software will operate uninterrupted or error-free, or that all errors will be corrected. This limited warranty is contingent upon Licensee notifying Licensor of any non-conformity within the Warranty Period, providing sufficient detail for Licensor to reproduce the issue.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR BE SUITABLE FOR ANY SPECIFIC PURPOSE.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensee from and against any third-party claims, demands, suits, or proceedings brought against Licensee alleging that the Software, as provided by Licensor and used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes any valid patent, copyright, or trade secret of a third party. Licensor's obligations under this section are conditioned upon Licensee providing prompt written notice of any such claim, granting Licensor sole control over the defense and settlement thereof, and providing reasonable assistance at Licensor's expense.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensor from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to Licensee's (a) unauthorized use of the Software, including any use exceeding the Usage Limits; (b) breach of any provision of this Agreement, including but not limited to confidentiality obligations; or (c) violation of any applicable law or regulation in connection with its use of the Software. This indemnification obligation shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n        <p>\n            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, INCURRED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND SHALL NOT BE INCREASED BY THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM OR INCIDENT.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>11. Termination</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement may be terminated: (a) by either party upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within [NUMBER] days after receiving written notice thereof, provided such breach is curable; (b) by either party immediately upon written notice if the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or ceases to conduct business in the ordinary course; or (c) as otherwise provided in Section 4 (Term).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to Licensee hereunder shall immediately cease. Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software and Documentation and, within [NUMBER] days, return or destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation and certify such destruction in writing to Licensor. Sections 6 (Confidentiality), 7 (Intellectual Property), 9 (Indemnification), 10 (Limitation of Liability), 12 (Governing Law), and 13 (Dispute Resolution) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [JURISDICTION, e.g., the State of Delaware], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement, thereby excluding its application in its entirety.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in [COUNTY/CITY, STATE, e.g., New Castle County, Delaware] for any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that such litigation brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n        <p>\n            Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiations between senior representatives of both parties, who shall have the authority to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within [NUMBER] days, either party may initiate mediation by providing written notice to the other party.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within [NUMBER] days after the commencement of mediation, the dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by [ARBITRATION BODY, e.g., the American Arbitration Association] in accordance with its [APPLICABLE RULES, e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules] then in effect. The arbitration shall take place in [CITY, STATE], and the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon both parties, and judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>\n        <p>\n            <b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement, together with any referenced appendices or schedules, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, whether written or oral. No terms or conditions contained in any purchase order or other document issued by Licensee shall be deemed to amend or supplement this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Amendments.</b> No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties. Any waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Severability.</b> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

This includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, business plans, product roadmaps, customer lists, pricing information, and technical specifications of the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This definition specifically excludes information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written records; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the Disclosing Party to allow for protective measures.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Documentation\"</b> means all user manuals, technical manuals, release notes, and other materials, whether in print or electronic form, that describe the installation, operation, and use of the Software. This definition encompasses any updates, supplements, or revisions to such materials provided by Licensor to Licensee during the term of this Agreement, which are intended to facilitate the proper and effective utilization of the Software.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Documentation is considered an integral part of the Software license and is subject to the same intellectual property protections and usage restrictions as the Software itself. Licensee's right to use the Documentation is solely for internal reference and support of its authorized use of the Software, and no other purpose.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"License\"</b> means the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited right granted by Licensor to Licensee to install and use the Software and Documentation strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. This License explicitly excludes any right to sublicense, distribute, or otherwise make the Software available to third parties, or to use it for purposes beyond Licensee's internal business operations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The scope of this License is precisely defined by the Usage Limits and Restrictions set forth in Section 3 and Appendix A, and any use beyond these defined parameters shall be considered outside the scope of the License and a material breach of this Agreement. No implied licenses are granted under this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Software\"</b> means the proprietary software identified as \"[SOFTWARE NAME]\", including all modules, components, features, updates, upgrades, enhancements, modifications, and related documentation provided by Licensor. This definition encompasses both the object code and, where expressly provided in writing by Licensor, any source code, along with all associated intellectual property rights, regardless of the medium or form.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Software is provided as a complete product, and any modifications, adaptations, or derivative works created by Licensee, even if based on authorized use, shall remain the exclusive property of Licensor. This definition also includes any third-party software components embedded within the Software, for which Licensor has obtained necessary licenses for inclusion.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>\"Usage Limits\"</b> means specific restrictions on the use of the Software, which may include, but are not limited to, the maximum number of authorized users, concurrent users, installations, processing capacity, data storage, or transactional volume, as detailed in Appendix A attached hereto or the applicable order form. These limits are fundamental to the scope of the granted License and any exceeding thereof constitutes a material breach.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            These Usage Limits are established to ensure the proper functioning of the Software and to protect Licensor's intellectual property and business model.

Grant of License</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable (under specific conditions outlined in Section 11), limited license to install and use the object code version of the Software and the accompanying Documentation solely for Licensee's internal business operations. This license is strictly limited by the Usage Limits specified in Appendix A and does not include any right to sublicense, distribute, or otherwise make the Software available to third parties, nor does it grant any rights to the Software's source code unless explicitly agreed upon in a separate written addendum.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Licensee is expressly prohibited from using the Software for any purposes other than those explicitly permitted herein, including but not limited to, providing service bureau services, commercial hosting, or any other commercial exploitation of the Software for the benefit of third parties. Any use beyond the defined Usage Limits or for unauthorized purposes shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate termination of the license, in addition to Licensor pursuing all available legal and equitable remedies for damages incurred.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>3. Usage Limits and Restrictions</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensee's use of the Software is strictly limited to [SPECIFY LIMITS, e.g., a maximum of X concurrent users, Y installations on designated servers, Z transactions per month], as further detailed in Appendix A. Licensee shall not exceed these specified limits without obtaining a separate written agreement and, if applicable, paying additional fees to Licensor. Licensee agrees to implement reasonable technical measures and internal policies to monitor and enforce these usage limits, and shall provide periodic reports to Licensor upon request demonstrating compliance.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Software or Documentation; (b) rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, or otherwise transfer rights in the Software or Documentation; (c) remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on the Software or Documentation; (d) use the Software to develop any competing product or service; or (e) use the Software in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation, including but not limited to data privacy laws.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>4. Term</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial term of [NUMBER] years (the \"Initial Term\"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive [NUMBER] year periods (each, a \"Renewal Term\"), unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal to the other party at least [NUMBER] days prior to the end of the then-current term. Such notice of non-renewal must be clear and unambiguous.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Licensee's right to use the Software is strictly contingent upon the continuous effectiveness of this Agreement. In the event of termination or expiration, Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software and Documentation, and shall, within [NUMBER] days, certify in writing to Licensor that all copies of the Software and Documentation, including any backup or archival copies, have been permanently deleted from its systems and destroyed. Failure to provide such certification within the stipulated timeframe shall be considered a material breach.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall pay Licensor the license fees as set forth in Appendix B or the applicable order form executed by both parties. All fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, such as in the case of a material uncured breach by Licensor. Payments shall be due within [NUMBER] days of the invoice date, and all invoices shall clearly detail the services rendered and the corresponding fees.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the event of late payment, Licensor reserves the right to charge interest on overdue amounts at the rate of [PERCENTAGE]% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, calculated from the due date until the date of full payment. Licensor may also suspend Licensee's access to the Software or terminate this Agreement for material breach if payments remain outstanding for more than [NUMBER] days after Licensee receives written notice of delinquency from Licensor.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>\n        <p>\n            Each party acknowledges that during the term of this Agreement, it may have access to Confidential Information of the other party. Each party agrees to maintain the strictest confidentiality of all such Confidential Information and to use it solely for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. Neither party shall disclose, reproduce, or transmit any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, and shall implement reasonable security measures to protect such information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The obligations of confidentiality shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of [NUMBER] years, or indefinitely for trade secrets. These obligations do not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written records; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the Disclosing Party to allow for protective measures.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all right, title, and interest in and to the Software and Documentation, including all associated intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights), are and shall remain exclusively with Licensor or its licensors. This Agreement grants only a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Software and does not convey any ownership interest or rights in the Software or Documentation to Licensee, nor does it imply any transfer of intellectual property.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall not challenge or assist any third party in challenging Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Software or Documentation, nor shall it register or attempt to register any intellectual property rights that are confusingly similar to those of Licensor. Any feedback, suggestions, or improvements provided by Licensee regarding the Software shall be deemed the sole property of Licensor, and Licensor shall be free to use, incorporate, and exploit such feedback without any obligation, restriction, or compensation to Licensee.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8. Warranties</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor warrants that for a period of [NUMBER] days from the Effective Date (the \"Warranty Period\"), the Software will substantially conform to the specifications set forth in the Documentation when used in accordance with this Agreement. Licensor does not warrant that the Software will operate uninterrupted or error-free, or that all errors will be corrected. This limited warranty is contingent upon Licensee notifying Licensor of any non-conformity within the Warranty Period, providing sufficient detail for Licensor to reproduce the issue.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR BE SUITABLE FOR ANY SPECIFIC PURPOSE.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>\n        <p>\n            Licensor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensee from and against any third-party claims, demands, suits, or proceedings brought against Licensee alleging that the Software, as provided by Licensor and used within the scope of this Agreement, infringes any valid patent, copyright, or trade secret of a third party. Licensor's obligations under this section are conditioned upon Licensee providing prompt written notice of any such claim, granting Licensor sole control over the defense and settlement thereof, and providing reasonable assistance at Licensor's expense.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Licensor from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to Licensee's (a) unauthorized use of the Software, including any use exceeding the Usage Limits; (b) breach of any provision of this Agreement, including but not limited to confidentiality obligations; or (c) violation of any applicable law or regulation in connection with its use of the Software. This indemnification obligation shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n        <p>\n            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, INCURRED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND SHALL NOT BE INCREASED BY THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM OR INCIDENT.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>11. Termination</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement may be terminated: (a) by either party upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within [NUMBER] days after receiving written notice thereof, provided such breach is curable; (b) by either party immediately upon written notice if the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or ceases to conduct business in the ordinary course; or (c) as otherwise provided in Section 4 (Term).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to Licensee hereunder shall immediately cease. Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Software and Documentation and, within [NUMBER] days, return or destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation and certify such destruction in writing to Licensor. Sections 6 (Confidentiality), 7 (Intellectual Property), 9 (Indemnification), 10 (Limitation of Liability), 12 (Governing Law), and 13 (Dispute Resolution) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>\n        <p>\n            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [JURISDICTION, e.g., the State of Delaware], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement, thereby excluding its application in its entirety.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts located in [COUNTY/CITY, STATE, e.g., New Castle County, Delaware] for any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that such litigation brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n        <p>\n            Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall first be subject to good faith negotiations between senior representatives of both parties, who shall have the authority to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within [NUMBER] days, either party may initiate mediation by providing written notice to the other party.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If mediation fails to resolve the dispute within [NUMBER] days after the commencement of mediation, the dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by [ARBITRATION BODY, e.g., the American Arbitration Association] in accordance with its [APPLICABLE RULES, e.g., Commercial Arbitration Rules] then in effect. The arbitration shall take place in [CITY, STATE], and the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon both parties, and judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2>\n        <p>\n            <b>Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement, together with any referenced appendices or schedules, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, whether written or oral. No terms or conditions contained in any purchase order or other document issued by Licensee shall be deemed to amend or supplement this Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Amendments.</b> No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties.

The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <b>Assignment.</b> Licensee may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Licensor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Definitions</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this Data Processing Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:</p>\n<p><strong>\"Agreement\"</strong> means this Data Processing Agreement, including all appendices and schedules attached hereto, which forms an integral part of the principal agreement between [Party A] (the \"Controller\") and [Party B] (the \"Processor\") for the provision of services, effective as of [Effective Date].</p>\n<p><strong>\"Controller\"</strong> means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data, as defined in Article 4(7) of the GDPR. In this Agreement, the Controller is [Party A].</p>\n<p><strong>\"Processor\"</strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Controller, as defined in Article 4(8) of the GDPR. In this Agreement, the Processor is [Party B].</p>\n<p><strong>\"Data Subject\"</strong> means an identified or identifiable natural person to whom Personal Data relates, as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR. This includes, but is not limited to, customers, employees, or other individuals whose Personal Data is processed under this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Personal Data\"</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\"Data Subject\"), as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR. This includes, without limitation, names, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person, which is processed by the Processor on behalf of the Controller pursuant to this Agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Processing\"</strong> means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction, as defined in Article 4(2) of the GDPR.</p>\n<p><strong>\"GDPR\"</strong> means the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (Data Protection Directive).</p>\n<p><strong>\"Personal Data Breach\"</strong> means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, as defined in Article 4(12) of the GDPR.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Sub-processor\"</strong> means any third party appointed by the Processor, or by another Sub-processor of the Processor, to process Personal Data on behalf of the Controller in connection with this Agreement.</p>\n<h2>2. Term and Termination</h2>\n<p>This Data Processing Agreement shall commence on the [Effective Date] and remain in full force and effect for the duration of the underlying service agreement (the \"Main Agreement\") between [Controller] and [Processor], or until such time as [Processor] no longer processes Personal Data on behalf of [Controller], whichever is later. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of the Main Agreement, or earlier if mutually agreed upon by both parties in writing, provided that all obligations related to the processing of Personal Data have been fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any termination, the provisions relating to data protection, confidentiality, and the obligations concerning the return or deletion of Personal Data shall survive the termination of this Agreement for as long as required by applicable law or until all such data has been securely deleted or returned in accordance with the terms herein. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, or upon [Controller]'s written request, [Processor] shall, at [Controller]'s option, either delete or return to [Controller] all Personal Data processed on behalf of [Controller], including all copies thereof, unless applicable law requires storage of the Personal Data.</p>\n<p>[Processor] shall, within a reasonable timeframe (not exceeding ninety (90) days) following such request or termination, provide written certification to [Controller] that all Personal Data has been deleted or returned as required by this Section. The costs associated with the return or deletion of Personal Data shall be borne by [Processor], unless otherwise specified in the Main Agreement or mutually agreed upon in writing.</p>\n<h2>3. Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>The Processor undertakes to keep confidential all Personal Data, as defined in Article 4(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), processed on behalf of the Controller, and all information related to the Controller's business operations, systems, and security measures that the Processor may access or become aware of during the performance of the Services under the Main Agreement and this Data Processing Agreement (DPA). This obligation extends to the terms and conditions of this DPA itself.</p>\n<p>The Processor shall ensure that all persons authorized to process the Personal Data, including but not limited to its employees, agents, and subprocessors, have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. The Processor shall provide adequate training to its personnel regarding their obligations to protect Personal Data and maintain confidentiality, and shall implement internal policies and procedures to enforce these obligations.</p>\n<p>The Processor shall not disclose or permit the disclosure of any Personal Data to any third party, nor use any Personal Data for any purpose other than for the performance of the Services as explicitly instructed by the Controller, unless expressly required by applicable law. In such a case, the Processor shall, to the extent legally permissible, inform the Controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.</p>\n<p>The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 3 shall survive the termination or expiration of this DPA and the Main Agreement for as long as the Personal Data remains in the Processor's possession or control, or otherwise remains confidential in nature.</p>\n<h2>4. Warranties</h2>\n<p>Each Party warrants to the other that it has the full power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement. The [Data Processor] warrants that it shall process Personal Data strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the documented instructions of the [Data Controller], and all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\"GDPR\"). The [Data Processor] further warrants that it has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The [Data Controller] warrants that it has all necessary rights, consents, and lawful bases to enable the [Data Processor] to lawfully process the Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement for the purposes contemplated herein, and that its instructions to the [Data Processor] comply with all applicable laws, including the GDPR. Both Parties warrant that they will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the performance of their respective obligations under this Agreement, effective as of [Effective Date].</p>\n<h2>5. Indemnification</h2>\n<p>\n    Each Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the \"Indemnified Party\"), its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach by the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Data Processing Agreement, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (\"GDPR\"), or any other applicable data protection laws. Specifically, [Processor] shall indemnify [Controller] for claims arising from [Processor]'s failure to comply with its obligations herein, including but not limited to unauthorized processing, data breaches attributable to [Processor]'s negligence or willful misconduct, or non-compliance with [Controller]'s lawful instructions. Conversely, [Controller] shall indemnify [Processor] for claims arising from [Controller]'s failure to comply with its obligations herein, including but not limited to unlawful instructions provided to [Processor] or failure to ensure the legality of the initial collection and processing of Personal Data. The indemnification obligations are contingent upon the Indemnified Party providing prompt written notice of any claim and reasonable cooperation in the defense thereof.\n</p>\n<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>6.1. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of goodwill, or loss of data, arising out of or in connection with this Data Processing Agreement (the \"DPA\") or the services provided hereunder, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, even if such Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>\n<p>6.2. The limitations set forth in Section 6.1 shall not apply to damages arising from a Party's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, breach of confidentiality obligations, or any breach of its obligations under Articles 82 (Right to Compensation and Liability) or 83 (Administrative Fines) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that directly results in administrative fines or penalties imposed by a competent Supervisory Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, the monetary cap specified in Section 6.3 shall not apply to any fines or penalties imposed by a Supervisory Authority under the GDPR for which a Party is solely or jointly liable, where such liability arises directly from that Party's material breach of its obligations under this DPA or the GDPR.</p>\n<p>6.3. Subject to Section 6.2, each Party's total aggregate liability under or in connection with this DPA, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall in no event exceed the greater of: (a) the total fees paid or payable by [Controller Name] to [Processor Name] under the Principal Agreement in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim; or (b) [Specific Monetary Cap Amount, e.g., EUR 1,000,000].</p>\n<p>6.4. Nothing in this Section 6 shall limit the Controller's duty to mitigate its damages, nor shall it relieve either Party of its statutory obligations under applicable data protection laws, including the GDPR.</p>\n<h2>7. Governing Law</h2>\n<p>This Data Processing Agreement, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction, e.g., Ireland or Germany], without regard to its conflict of law principles. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of [Jurisdiction, e.g., Ireland or Germany] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). This choice of law and jurisdiction is made to ensure full compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or \"GDPR\") and other applicable data protection laws within the European Union. The parties acknowledge that this choice of law provides a robust and predictable legal framework for the processing of personal data under this Agreement, ensuring clarity and enforceability of data protection obligations.</p>\n<h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including its existence, validity, interpretation, or termination, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve such dispute amicably through good faith negotiations. Either [Party A] or [Party B] may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party, clearly outlining the nature of the dispute and the proposed resolution.</p>\n<p>If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days of the initial notice, the dispute shall be escalated to senior management representatives of both Parties who shall meet within an additional fifteen (15) days to seek a resolution. Should the dispute remain unresolved after such senior management discussions, the Parties agree to consider non-binding mediation conducted by a mutually agreed-upon mediator, with the costs shared equally between the Parties.</p>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, which cannot be resolved amicably or through mediation, shall be finally settled by litigation. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Governing Law], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Jurisdiction] for the purpose of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, and waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts.</p>\n<h2>9. Signatures</h2>\n<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Data Processing Agreement as of the Effective Date, acknowledging their full understanding and acceptance of its terms and conditions. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Electronic signatures, including those transmitted by facsimile or email, shall be deemed original for all purposes and shall have the same legal effect as original signatures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR THE DATA CONTROLLER:</strong></p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>By: ________________________________</p>\n<p>Name: [Printed Name of Authorized Representative]</p>\n<p>Title: [Title of Authorized Representative]</p>\n<p>Date: ________________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>FOR THE DATA PROCESSOR:</strong></p>\n<p>____________________________________</p>\n<p>By: ________________________________</p>\n<p>Name: [Printed Name of Authorized Representative]</p>\n<p>Title: [Title of Authorized Representative]</p>\n<p>Date: ________________________________</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>",

Subprocessors</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall not engage another processor (\"Subprocessor\") without prior specific or general written authorisation of the Controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes. Where the Processor engages a Subprocessor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the Controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in this DPA shall be imposed on that Subprocessor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall remain fully liable to the Controller for the performance of the Subprocessor's obligations. The Processor shall ensure that any Subprocessor it engages complies with the terms of this DPA and the GDPR, including implementing appropriate security measures and providing assistance with Data Subject rights requests. The Processor shall maintain an up-to-date list of its Subprocessors and provide it to the Controller upon request, ensuring transparency regarding all entities involved in the processing chain.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. These measures shall include, at a minimum, those specified in [Reference to an Appendix or specific security policy, e.g., Annex A to this DPA], which may be updated from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            These measures are designed to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. The Processor shall regularly test, assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing, and shall adjust these measures as necessary to maintain an appropriate level of security in light of evolving threats and technological advancements.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>7. Data Subject Rights</h2>\n        <p>\n            Taking into account the nature of the processing, the Processor shall assist the Controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR (e.g., right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, objection). The Processor shall promptly notify the Controller if it receives a request from a Data Subject concerning their Personal Data, and shall not respond to such request unless expressly authorised by the Controller.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall provide the Controller with all necessary information and cooperation to enable the Controller to respond to Data Subject requests within the prescribed timescales. This assistance may include, but is not limited to, providing access to the relevant Personal Data, facilitating corrections or deletions, and providing information about the processing activities. The costs associated with such assistance shall be borne by the Controller, unless the request arises from a breach of this DPA by the Processor.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>8. Personal Data Breach Notification</h2>\n        <p>\n            In the event of a Personal Data Breach, the Processor shall notify the Controller without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 48 hours after becoming aware of it. The notification shall at least: (a) describe the nature of the Personal Data Breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned; (b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained; (c) describe the likely consequences of the Personal Data Breach; (d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Processor to address the Personal Data Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall cooperate fully with the Controller in investigating, mitigating, and remedying any Personal Data Breach. This includes providing the Controller with all reasonable assistance, information, and documentation necessary to enable the Controller to comply with its notification obligations to the competent supervisory authority and to the affected Data Subjects under Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR. The Processor shall also take all reasonable steps to prevent future Personal Data Breaches and shall document any Personal Data Breaches, including the facts relating to the Personal Data Breach, its effects and the remedial action taken.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>9. Data Transfers</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall not transfer Personal Data to a country outside of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") or to an international organisation without the prior written consent of the Controller. Any such transfer, if consented to by the Controller, shall only occur if adequate safeguards are in place as required by Chapter V of the GDPR, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, binding corporate rules, or an adequacy decision.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall ensure that any Subprocessor involved in the transfer of Personal Data outside the EEA also adheres to the same strict transfer mechanisms and safeguards. The Processor shall provide evidence of such safeguards to the Controller upon request, ensuring that all international data transfers comply fully with GDPR requirements and that Data Subjects' rights are adequately protected throughout the data lifecycle, regardless of geographic location.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>10. Audit Rights</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA and Article 28 of the GDPR, and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor mandated by the Controller. Such audits shall be conducted at the Controller's expense, during normal business hours, with reasonable prior written notice (not less than [e.g., thirty (30)] days), and shall not unreasonably interfere with the Processor's business operations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The scope of any audit shall be limited to assessing the Processor's compliance with this DPA and the GDPR in relation to the processing of Personal Data on behalf of the Controller. The Processor shall cooperate fully with any audit, providing access to relevant personnel, data, and documentation as reasonably required. The parties shall agree on the scope and methodology of any audit in advance, and any findings shall be treated as confidential information.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>11. Return and Deletion of Data</h2>\n        <p>\n            Upon termination of the Main Agreement or cessation of the processing services, or upon the Controller's written request, the Processor shall, at the Controller's option, either delete all Personal Data processed on behalf of the Controller and delete existing copies, or return all Personal Data to the Controller and delete existing copies, unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data. The Processor shall ensure that all copies of the Personal Data are irrevocably deleted from its systems, including backups, within a reasonable timeframe, typically no later than [e.g., ninety (90)] days following the Controller's instruction or termination of services.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall provide the Controller with written certification that all Personal Data has been deleted or returned as instructed. This certification shall confirm that the Processor has taken all reasonable steps to erase or return the data and that no further copies are retained, except where legally mandated. The Processor acknowledges that failure to comply with this clause may result in significant legal and financial consequences, and therefore commits to a thorough and verifiable process for data handling at the end of the processing term.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>12. Term and Termination</h2>\n        <p>\n            This DPA shall come into effect on the Effective Date of DPA and shall remain in force for the duration of the Main Agreement, including any extensions or renewals thereof, or until the Processor ceases to process Personal Data on behalf of the Controller, whichever is later. The termination or expiration of the Main Agreement shall automatically terminate this DPA, subject to the Processor's obligations regarding the return or deletion of Personal Data as set forth in Clause 11.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Clauses that by their nature should survive the termination of this DPA, including but not limited to clauses relating to confidentiality, indemnification, and the return or deletion of data, shall remain in full force and effect. Termination of this DPA shall not relieve either party of any liabilities or obligations incurred prior to the effective date of termination.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>\n        <p>\n            The liability of each party under this DPA shall be subject to the limitations of liability set forth in the Main Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the limitation of liability provisions in this DPA and the Main Agreement, the provisions of the Main Agreement shall prevail, except where such provisions would limit a party's liability for a breach of its obligations under the GDPR to an extent not permitted by applicable law.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to this DPA, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The parties acknowledge that the allocation of risk and liability in this DPA and the Main Agreement reflects the commercial agreement between them and is a material consideration for entering into this DPA.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>\n        <p>\n            The Processor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Controller from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any breach by the Processor of its obligations under this DPA or the GDPR, to the extent such breach causes a Personal Data Breach or other violation of data protection law. This indemnification obligation shall not apply to the extent that the claim arises from the Controller's unlawful instructions or breach of its obligations under this DPA.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The Controller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Processor from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with any unlawful instructions provided by the Controller to the Processor or any breach by the Controller of its obligations under this DPA or the GDPR. Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith in the defense of any such claims and to mitigate any damages.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>\n        <p>\n            This DPA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Governing Law Jurisdiction, e.g., Ireland or Germany, or a specific EU Member State law, ensuring it aligns with GDPR]. This choice of law is made without regard to its conflict of laws principles.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of [Jurisdiction for Dispute Resolution, e.g., Dublin, Ireland or Berlin, Germany] shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this DPA or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). The parties waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts and agree not to plead or claim that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>\n        <p>\n            This DPA constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this DPA shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If any provision of this DPA is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under this DPA shall constitute a waiver of that right. This DPA may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n        </p>\n\n        <table class=\"no-border-table\">\n            <tr>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p><b>FOR THE CONTROLLER:</b></p>\n                    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    <p>___________________________________</p>\n                    <p>Name: [Controller Signatory Name]</p>\n                    <p>Title: [Controller Signatory Title]</p>\n                    <p>Date: [Date of Signature]</p>\n                </td>\n                <td style=\"width: 50%;\">\n                    <p><b>FOR THE PROCESSOR:</b></p>\n                    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    <p>___________________________________</p>\n                    <p>Name: [Processor Signatory Name]</p>\n                    <p>Title: [Processor Signatory Title]</p>\n                    <p>Date: [Date of Signature]</p>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>",
